The students never let up in cheering on their fellow Terriers in a big win for the team.\nRight away, BU looked primed to put on a show for their loud and proud supporters. Junior forward Tyler Scanlon scored six of the team’s first eight points on two threes, and in the first seven minutes the Terriers did not miss a shot.\nScanlon would lead all scorers in the first half with 12 points on 5-6 shooting from the floor.\nOn the defensive end, BU settled in to a 2-3 zone that they would use for the entire game. Although the Terriers gave up the ball a good amount themselves, their zone never allowed Holy Cross to get comfortable when the Crusaders (12-10, 3-6 Patriot League) were on offense.\nHoly Cross turned the ball over seven times in the first half, leading to several easy baskets for BU in transition. All night, BU defenders got into passing lanes and pestered Holy Cross ball handlers.\nAt the break, the Terriers led 30-26, but the score was not that close for long. BU went on a 21-9 run to start the half after big plays from junior forwards Max Mahoney and Tyler Scanlon.\nFirst, Mahoney raced down the floor for a putback dunk, forcing the Crusaders to call a timeout 2:16 into the half. Then, Scanlon came up with the steal and a dunk that sent the crowd into overdrive.\nA few minutes later, Mahoney made the crowd erupt again, scoring on a basket with a foul after a loose ball bounced off multiple players and sent a few to the floor. When the dust cleared, BU had a 51-35 lead and had effectively ended the game.\nThe duo of Scanlon and Mahoney was unstoppable against Holy Cross. Scanlon",

In comparison, the Holy Cross starting big men combined for just seven. Overall, the Terriers held a 42-18 advantage on the boards.\nSophomore guard Javante McCoy also led the team with 4 for 6 shooting from beyond the arc. As a team, BU shot 11-20 from long range. At 55 percent, it’s the best rate they have shot the three ball at all season.\nWith a four-game losing streak behind them, the Terriers will head to Colgate University Saturday. After arguably their best game of the season in conference play, BU has a chance to use this as fuel to go on a run in the second half of their Patriot League schedule."

        "prompt": "ASHEBORO, N.C. (Reuters) - When Bill McAnulty, an elections board chairman in a mostly white North Carolina county, agreed in July to open a Sunday voting site where black church members could cast ballots after services, the reaction was swift: he was labeled a traitor by his fellow Republicans.\n“I became a villain, quite frankly,” recalled McAnulty at a state board of elections meeting in September that had been called to resolve disputes over early voting plans. “I got accused of being a traitor and everything else by the Republican Party,” McAnulty said.\nFollowing the blowback from Republicans, McAnulty later withdrew his support for the Sunday site.\nIn an interview with Reuters, he said he ultimately ruled against opening the Sunday voting site in Randolph County because he had “made a mistake in reading the wishes of the voters.” He declined to discuss the episode further.\nThis year’s highly charged presidential contest between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump has stoked accusations by both parties of political meddling in the scheduling of early voting hours in North Carolina, a coveted battleground state with a history of tight elections.\nIn emails, state and county Republican officials lobbied members of at least 17 county election boards to keep early-voting sites open for shorter hours on weekends and in evenings – times that usually see disproportionately high turnout by Democratic voters. Reuters obtained the emails through a public records request.\nThe officials also urged county election boards to open fewer sites for residents to cast ballots during early voting that began on Oct. 20 and ends on Saturday.\nCivil rights advocates and Democrats launched their own campaigns for expanded early voting hours.\nThe tug-of-war yielded mixed results.\nThe state did ultimately add nearly 5,900 more hours and 78 more sites to vote early than in 2012. But several counties opened only one polling site during the first week of early voting, slightly denting turnout across the state. Voter turnout dropped by 20 percent in the counties that had multiple polling sites during the first week of early voting in 2012 but just one site during the first week in 2016.\n“We currently have more early voting locations and hours open than ever were open under Democrat control,” said North Carolina Republican Party executive director Dallas Woodhouse, denying his party was trying to suppress the Democratic vote.\nPresident Barack Obama praised the expanded early voting opportunities during an election stop in North Carolina on Wednesday.\nCounties that Obama, a Democrat, won in 2012 increased their Sunday hours this year by 16 percent, while counties that voted for his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, decreased them by nearly a quarter, the records show.\nState Republican officials say keeping polls open during evenings and weekends, or “off-hour” times, drains county resources.\nIn two emails, on Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, Woodhouse urged Republicans serving on county election boards to follow the “party line” on curtailing the early voting period.\n“Many of our folks are angry and opposed to Sunday voting,” he wrote. “Six days of voting in one week is enough. Period.” Keeping polling sites open for the full 17-day early voting period “may be wasteful and unnecessary,” he added.\nWoodhouse’s emails were subsequently published by local media, but he was not alone in lobbying to limit voting hours, the Reuters review of public records shows. The review counted similar emails from at least four other Republican Party officials to election boards, each of which is composed of two Republicans and one Democrat.\nThe same day that Woodhouse sent his Aug. 11 email, Elaine Hewitt, a member of the Rowan County Republican Executive Committee, sent the county elections board two proposed schedules for early voting, both of which included just one site for the first four days and no sites on Sundays.\n“With all of the opportunities to vote by mail, early in person Monday - Saturday, and on Election Day, there is no justification for requiring election workers to work on Sundays,” she wrote.\nGarry Terry, the chairman of the Republican Party for North Carolina’s First Congressional District, sent an email on Aug. 13 to elections board members in his region, reminding them to act “in the best interest of the Republican Party” by opposing Sunday voting and restricting early voting to one location.\nHewitt and Terry did not respond to requests for comment. Woodhouse defended the actions of the Republican officials, telling Reuters that Republican opposition to Sunday voting was not discriminatory but was rather based on the belief that people should not be required to work on Sundays.\nThe Sunday polling site that McAnulty first supported and then opposed would have been located at the Randolph County Board of Elections office and would have cost around $1,000 to operate, according to the office director.\n“If it’s not wasteful and it allows more people to vote... the board has historically been for that,” Margaret Megerian, the Democratic member of board, told Reuters.\nIn contrast with the Republicans’ email campaign, the Democratic push to expand early voting hours has largely taken shape in public forums.\nIn Democratic-leaning Guilford County, the state’s third largest, a county board of elections meeting on Aug. 8 attracted about 75 people after word spread that the board was planning to halve the number of early voting sites, from 24 in 2012.\nThe Rev. Nelson Johnson said in an interview that the proposal by the board’s Republican chairwoman would “prevent voting especially by people who can’t easily take time off” and said it “absolutely” had a racial intent. Johnson, who is African American, leads a community center in Greensboro, North Carolina.\nBoard Chairwoman Kathryn Lindley told Reuters she believed “a lesser number of sites would cause less confusion about which places were going to be open,” and that it was “ludicrous” to think her suggested plan had been discriminatory.\nThe board ultimately agreed to 25 early voting sites and one day of Sunday voting before the",
        "baseline": " November election. Johnson said the decision was “a significant triumph.” Lindley said Johnson’s group had no influence on the final outcome.\nGuilford’s plan also included one restriction that particularly angered Democrats. In the first week of early voting in 2012, residents could vote at 16 sites. This year, that has been reduced to one.\nMary Cranford, 52, a registered Republican, was fourth in line on the first day of early voting in Guilford. She was able to vote but said she was upset that only one site was open for the first week. She said she voted for Clinton this year.\n“I can’t believe what’s been done to keep some people from voting in this state,” she said.\nJust 7,916 people voted in the first week of early voting in Guilford this year, compared to 60,732 in 2012, according to state elections board records."

The goal has been “wealth” or “human welfare” at least since Adam Smith published “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” in 1776. But what exactly is human welfare? And how do we measure wealth?\nThe obvious way: money. Simply measure how much money a society or individual earns or possesses, because money is so damn simple to count. But various economists have rejected simple as simplistic. Do we not care about values other than money? Education, say? Freedom? Health?\nNobel laureate economist Amartya Sen, for example, has long proposed we instead use a “human development index” that includes variables beyond monetary wealth.\nAnd in using money as your key metric, you miss the side effects of becoming a latter day Uncle Scrooge, swimming in coin.\nConsider the potentially corrosive effects of money on a fellow like Scrooge — there’s experimental evidence that “rich people are more likely to break the law while driving, help themselves to candy meant for children, cheat in a game of chance” or lie, as demonstrated in a Making Sen$e story we did a few years ago. Or more broadly and starkly, imagine that a town becomes “rich” by building a chemical plant, but pollution from the plant poisons its citizens for decades to come.\nThe most dramatic finding is that U.S. counties vary in life expectancy by as much as 20 years.\nThere is, however, one measure that seems relatively unobjectionable: life expectancy at birth.

        "prompt": "German finance minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble looks on as Greece finance minister Yanis Varoufakis speaks.\nGreece’s new SYRIZA government submitted its list of proposed economic reforms to the Eurogroup (the finance ministers of eurozone nations) on February 23 as a precondition for its international creditors to approve a four-month loan extension. The deal was signed on February 20.\nWith Greece’s existing loan arrangement expiring on February 28 and bankruptcy looming, a last-minute deal was finally agreed after three weeks of intense negotiations. The talks had been characterised by daily — sometimes hourly — twists and turns, claims and counterclaims, leaks and threats.\nSYRIZA was elected on January 25 on a wave of hope and rejection of the crippling austerity measures imposed on Greece in return for economic “bail-out” programs by the “Troika” — the European Central Bank (ECB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU). The deal represents a significant compromise on its election platform.\nAny discussion of debt write-offs, “hair-cuts” or renegotiation has been postponed until the next round of negotiations. Funds earmarked for bank recapitalisation will have to be used for that purpose, rather than redirected towards meeting Greece’s desperate social needs.\nGreece no longer has to accept the unilateral diktats of the Troika and is able to negotiate with each body separately. But the new funding still comes with conditions. These include oversight by those same bodies, now referred to as “the institutions”, and restrictions on how the money can be used.\nThe SYRIZA government is required to refrain from any “rollback of measures and unilateral changes to the policies and structural reforms that would negatively impact fiscal targets, economic recovery or financial stability, as assessed by the institutions”.\nAlthough less than specific, this restriction includes any privatisations already completed, as well as those now underway. Depending on interpretation, this may also impact on measures promised by SYRIZA to improve social welfare, such as raising the minimum wage and restoring collective bargaining rights.\nOn the other hand, the agreement also includes measures that will improve SYRIZA’s ability to fund solutions to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Greece.\nTo gather funds, the government is able to crack down on corruption, tax avoidance, tax immunity (Greece’s powerful shipping owners, for instance, currently pay no tax) and smuggling.\nSuch measures target the vested interests of Greece’s powerful oligarchy — something previous governments deliberately avoided — and strengthen the revenue-raising capacity of the Greek state.\nThis approach has already achieved success, with a reported €500 million already raised. It still remains to be seen if enough revenue can be raised to address social needs while repaying Greece’s short-term debts — several billion euros are due for payment in the coming months.\nThe SYRIZA government has described the agreement as a qualified success. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis described it as “a small step in the right direction”.\nVaroufakis said that Greece is now the “co-author” of its own fate, no longer the victim of “autopilot austerity” where it meekly takes economic and policy directives from its creditors.\nIn a marathon 10-hour session on February 25, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras advocated the deal to his fellow SYRIZA MPs as a small but tangible win.\nAcknowledging the restrictive conditions in the interim agreement, Tsipras said that while it is an extension of pre-existing loan arrangements, it is not a continuation of the Memorandum of Understanding that accompanied the previous tranche of loans.\nTsipras said the new deal frees up the government from unrealistic primary surplus targets and “asphyxiating” policies of austerity. While “things remain difficult”, the prime minister said the conditions replace the previous government’s measures with targets based on SYRIZA’s “Thessaloniki program”, which it took into January’s election.\nSYRIZA’s leaders have faced severe internal criticism over the deal, however. It has mostly come from members of the party’s Left Platform, who consider the deal a near-capitulation to Greece’s creditors on the questions of debt and austerity. About 30 of SYRIZA’s 149 MPs, and four government ministers, belong to the Left Platform.\nA Left Platform leader and member of SYRIZA’s central committee, Stathis Kouvelakis, said SYRIZA had carried out a major retreat caused by a “mistaken strategy”. He said the deal showed it was impossible to break with austerity and Greece’s debt burden “within the existing European framework”.\nOn February 25, Greek energy minister and Left Platform supporter Panagiotis Lafazanis said the privatisation of Greece’s main energy company and energy grid operator would not go ahead, a statement that appears at odds with the deal’s conditions.\nThe SYRIZA government has emphasised that its promised social measures will go ahead. In a CNN interview on February 23, Varoufakis insisted “there will be no pension cuts, there will be no increases to Value-Added Tax, there will be a series of poverty-alleviation moves.\nVaroufakis conceded that Greece was forced into significant compromises, admitting on February 20 that he was asking Europe to meet Greece “not half-way, but one-fifth of the way”.\nIn the event, that was a lot more than powerful forces in Europe wanted to give them.\nSYRIZA was elected with a mandate to end austerity, resolve the country’s social crisis and rebuild the Greek economy. The humanitarian crisis caused by austerity has led to a widespread drop in living standards, with about one in four people unemployed (60% of youth) and an average 20% cut in wages for those in work.\nThe negotiation process, therefore, exposed the open contempt for democracy that lies at the heart of the European Union and the financial interests that it represents.\nSchäuble took this uncompromising stance into negotiations, using Germany's dominance within the Eurogroup to demand Greece’s total and unconditional capitulation.\nIf Greece was hoping for support from other countries suffering from austerity, however, it was disappointed. Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Finland — all facing rising political challenges to their pro-austerity governments — sided firmly with Germany, as did France and Italy, leaving Greece isolated.\nMeanwhile, Greece was faced with possible bankruptcy. A run on the banks led to an estimated €3 billion withdrawn in the week before February 20, on top of a further €12 billion withdrawn in January.\nIn the final days before the agreement, the ECB was preparing for a possible “Grexit” — a Greek exit from the eurozone, and therefore the EU.\nVaroufakis had already ruled out a voluntary Grexit on the basis of the economic damage it would cause and the boost it would give to the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn, already the third largest party in the Greek parliament.\nA series of compromise drafts were rejected by Schäuble, who accused the Greeks of trying to present a “Trojan horse”. The claim was echoed in an increasingly nationalistic German media, which blames “lazy Greeks”, rather than a predatory and poorly regulated banking system, for the crisis.\n",
        "baseline": "However, SYRIZA won exactly what Schäuble insisted so strenuously it would not get — a short-term loan extension, with a degree of control over spending to alleviate the worst elements of austerity.\nDifferences about the exact nature of the agreement appear to be emerging already.\nOn the one hand, the Greek government has presented the interim arrangement as a break from the Memorandum and its austerity policies.\nAfter the deal was struck, Schäuble exulted that “the Greeks certainly will have a difficult time explaining the deal to their voters”.\nFor its part, the IMF is concerned about the lack of “clear assurances that the [Greek] Government intends to undertake the reforms envisaged in the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies”.\nEven if the list of reforms is accepted by the Eurozone parliaments, the institutions have until the end of April to “refine” it. Key elements may yet be rejected."

        "prompt": "Who Was in Kiev’s Independence Square?\nNow that Viktor Yanukovych has gone, and new elections are promised, we need to assess the political and popular forces that succeeded in overturning Ukraine’s political system. Who were the protesters and what were their goals? At the barricades in central Kiev there were Ukrainian and EU flags, as well as portraits of the poet Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861), considered as a spiritual father of Ukrainian identity, and of Stepan Bandera (1909-1959) who was, depending on your point of view, either a great patriot or a Nazi collaborator. And there were pictures of five Ukrainian activists, treated as martyrs after they were killed during the clashes in Grushevsky Street.\nMaidan Nezalezhnosti, Kiev’s Independence Square, the epicentre of the protests that had been taking place across Ukraine for three months, was filled with tents pitched by sympathisers from every part of the country: from Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk, the strongholds of nationalism, but also from Lugansk and Donetsk, the big cities of the industrial east, which have always felt close to Russia. Cossacks wore their traditional costume. Women brought black bread and ham to the men standing guard. There was a pervasive smell of tea, cabbage soup and wood fires. During the week, the few thousand activists went about their day-to-day business; on Sundays, tens of thousands came to hear speeches by opposition leaders, pray and sing the national anthem, tirelessly.\nThe protest movement emerged in November last year, after Yanukovych suspended negotiations on a free trade agreement with the European Union (1). Independence Square was gradually transformed. The first to arrive were a few thousand pro-European partisans, but as repression began the square became a symbol of revolt against a corrupt and mercenary political system for many others — initially a revolt against the Yanukovych system, but also a rejection of the opposition parties, out of their depth in this crisis.\nThe involvement of several nationalist groups — a small but highly visible presence — and of ultra-radical, non-democratic movements without European sympathies has produced different reactions. Their presence was used actively by Russia, and to some extent by Yanukovych’s government, to discredit the movement. But it also raised fears of a possible takeover of Independence Square by the far right — even though a popular movement was behind the protests and any attempt to categorise it in political terms would be an over-simplification.\nThe far right is largely modelled on the nationalist movement that developed from the 1920s, when most of what is now Ukraine was divided between Poland and Soviet Russia. From the start it was shaped by a variety of influences: Italian fascism, the partial collaboration — for pragmatic or ideological reasons — of some of its representatives (such as Bandera) with Nazi Germany, the participation of several Ukrainian battalions in the massacre of Jewish and Polish civilians during the second world war.\nPolitical scientist Andreas Umland, who teaches at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, said: “There are no objective historical accounts of Bandera’s [career]. Russian historians portray him as a fascist ally of the Nazis, while Ukrainian historians praise him without reserve. His admirers on Independence Square take a naïve and biased view of him, which is a problem. But it seems equally biased and dishonest to call him a fascist, as the Russians do” (2).\nDormant during the Soviet era, the nationalist movement reappeared after independence in 1991, when the Social-National Party of Ukraine (SNPU) was formed. Until the early 2000s, the SNPU was a marginal, xenophobic and ultra-nationalist organisation, and what little support it had was largely in the west of the country. Its leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, was elected to the Ukrainian parliament for the first time in 1998.\nIn search of respectability, Svoboda established relations with other European far-right parties. Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of France’s Front National, attended the 2004 congress as guest of honour. Svoboda also moderated its nationalist stance and references to Bandera — about whom Ukrainians do not agree — and gradually adopted a more general discourse, relatively common among the European far right, based on radical and vehement criticism of “the system”.\nThis did not prevent Tyahnybok from making statements that recall his xenophobic and anti-Semitic roots. In 2004 he declared that the Ukraine was governed by a “Jewish-Russian mafia”, which led to his exclusion from the Nasha Ukraina (Our Ukraine) parliamentary group. In 2005 he wrote an open letter to the president, demanding that he “put an end to the criminal activities of Ukrainian Jewry”.\nAt the parliamentary elections in 2012, Svoboda won nearly 10.5% of the vote and 37 seats in parliament. With more than two million votes, it became a party of national importance, achieving significant results in parts of the country other than the west, which is traditionally more receptive to nationalism.\nSvoboda, “probably on the advice of [France’s] Front National”, according to Andreas Umland,has also drawn up an economic programme with a social dimension. This would renationalise a number of enterprises, introduce progressive taxation on business profits, and seek to reduce the dominance of the oligarchs over the political and economic systems. These measures, together with the promise of a vigorous campaign against corruption, have attracted some categories of voters, especially small businessmen and members of the middle class, who have been particularly affected by the crisis and by nepotism, which has increased since Yanukovych was elected.\nA number of initiatives under Yanukovych’s presidency have irritated voters keen to defend the Ukrainian language and identity. They include a law on regional languages that came into effect in summer 2012 and allows regions that wish to do so to make Russian their second official language, or to reduce Ukrainian language-teaching in schools, as it is “unnecessary”, according to the education minister, Dmytro Tabachnyk.\nThough re-centred, Svoboda is still anchored in the far right. Its lead policy is the strengthening of Ukrainian national identity, which implies an end to Russian influence. On the foreign policy side, this translates into a wish to see Ukraine join NATO, rearm with nuclear weapons and leave all post-Soviet cooperative organisations.\nAmong Svoboda’s domestic priorities is “de-Sovietisation”: purging or sidelining former SNPU cadres and KGB agents, changing street and place names, removing monuments to heroes of the Soviet Union. Svoboda also proposes to abolish Crimea’s autonomous status and promote Ukrainian national identity through measures ranging from systematic glorification of the nationalist movement to reintroducing the mentions of religious affiliation and ethnicity on identity documents.\nSvoboda wants to see Ukraine join the EU. This pragmatic change of stance is inspired more by the tactical necessity for a “sacred union” with other opposition forces, and by electoral goals, than by a sincere desire to join, though Svoboda does also see the EU as a way of keeping Russia at a distance.\nThe party has also tried to disassociate itself from anti-Semitism, to the point where Joseph Zisels, chairman of the Association of Jewish Communities in the Ukraine, assured me that “Svoboda presents no threat to Jews. Their real enemy is the Russians. … It’s true that it’s the only major party to take Bandera andShukhevych (3) as its heroes, which I admit is awkward, but for all that it is not anti-Semitic.” This has not prevented a few slip-ups, for instance when Svoboda MP Igor Miroshnichenko in November 2012 denied that US actress Mila Kunis had Ukrainian roots, saying that she was in fact a jidovka, an ambiguous Ukrainian slang word meaning a person of Jewish faith or ancestry.\nSvoboda has been highly visible in Independence Square — it controlled Kiev city hall, occupied until 16 February — but ultimately has little influence over the demonstrators, as is the case for other opposition parties. This political void, coupled with the violence used by the authorities over the past few weeks, culminating in a pitched battle, has created conditions favourable to the emergence of new groups, whose style and ideological stance have raised many questions.\nThe biggest, Pravy Sektor (right sector), emerged after the Grushevsky Street clashes and, for the moment, enjoys real popular support. It has a few thousand members across the country, including people disappointed by Svoboda, members of ultra-nationalist groups, hooligans and dropouts. Their common denominator is a taste for radical action, and for the ideology that one of the movement’s leaders, Andrei Tarassenko, dispensed from its high-security headquarters on the fifth floor of Trade Union House, on Independence Square. Pravy Sektor defines itself as “neither xenophobic nor anti-Semitic, as Kremlin propaganda claims” and above all as “nationalist, defending the values of white, Christian Europe against the loss of the nation and deregionalisation”. Like Svoboda, it rejects multiculturalism, as “responsible for the disappearance of the crucifix and the arrival of girls in burqas in your schools”, but it does not advocate joining the EU, which it describes as “liberal totalitarianism in which God has vanished and values are turned upside down”.\nPravy Sektor supports none of the opposition parties, especially not Svoboda, disappointed by its “appeals for calm and negotiation with the authorities”. It could contemplate becoming a party itself, which would be awkward for Svoboda’s Tyahnybok: besides seeing his reputation as an anti-system champion seriously dented by his appeals for moderation during the clashes, he would have to come to terms with a party even further to the right, whose feats of arms and determination are known.\nSvoboda’s success over the past few years and the presence of neo-fascist groups such as Pravy Sektor in Independence Square are signs of a crisis in Ukrainian society. It is first and foremost a crisis of identity: in 22 years of independence, Ukraine has not managed to develop an unbiased historical narrative presenting a positive view of all its regions and citizens: even today, the Ukrainians are seen as liberators in Galicia but as fascists in Donbass. It is also a political crisis: some Ukrainians, exasperated and disappointed with the",

        "prompt": "A cartographer that created maps for senior policy makers at the National Counterterrorism Center wants to map out your next hunt or backpacking trip.\nBen Harshyne and his wife Kate Harshyne took a risk this year when Ben left his job as a contractor where he made maps for the National Counterterrorism Center and chose to work full time on a company he started called HUNTERRA Mapping.\nHUNTERRA creates maps by blending high-resolution aerial photography with a 3D-like terrain model. The company can create waterproof, tear resistant field maps, poster maps and custom-sized mega maps.\nHarshyne got the idea for the company after he made a hunting map for his father for Father’s Day four years ago. He didn’t want to create a map with only an aerial photo because it only showed tree cover, and terrain was important to understand the best places to deer hunt. Harshyne upgraded it by blending in terrain by simulating shadows created from the sun. He also digitized the trails, and highlighted the family’s different tree stands.\nHis father was impressed by the product and the map proved useful in the following hunting season.\nOn a hunting trip to Illinois, Harshyne and his father showed the map to the owner of an outfitting company. He was similarly impressed since he typically printed his maps off on Google. The outfitter, Aaron Milliken, went on to work for a real estate company called Whitetail Properties that sells hunting properties.\nHarshyne first thought he had an opportunity to build the business that became HUNTERRA once Whitetail Properties asked him to build maps to show off the property listings. Harshyne stood up HUNTERRA in 2011, but he was still working on the maps part time while he maintained his full time post at NCTC.\nThe company continued to grow as Harshyne designed a website where hunters could visit and order maps specific to their upcoming hunts. The work load grew and eventually Kate Harshyne quit her job in the culinary industry to work on HUNTERRA full time.\nThe Harshynes went all in this summer when Ben quit his job and the couple sold their northern Virginia home to move to the Midwest and be closer to the hunting grounds that they most often map. In fact, the couple refurbished a 1979 Airstream Excella trailer and is driving across the U.S. to promote HUNTERRA.\nThe company currently offers three types of maps: the field map, the poster map and the mega map. The field map is a tear resistant, waterproof map that hunters or hikers can fold up and store in their pocket. The map is 10 x 15 inches and is meant to accompany you in the field, and can be marked up with dry erase Crayons or permanent Sharpies.\nThe poster map comes in three sizes -- 20 x 30 inches, 30 x 45 inches and 40 x 60 inches. A light adhesive on the back makes it easy to hang on the wall or stick to a table.\nThe mega map allows hunters and bikers to pick any size. Harshyne said he uses a mosaic of multiple sheets to build huge displays for large properties and ranches without losing the detail that his customers require.\nHUNTERRA has already received national exposure through its work with Whitetail Properties. The company has a hunting show on the Sportsman Channel in which some of HUNTERRA’",
        "baseline": "s maps have been featured. Harshyne said he worked for nearly an entire winter on the first maps Whitetail asked him to produce as graphics on the show.\nHUNTERRA has also been featured at national conventions such as the National Wild Turkey Federation Convention and the Quality Deer Management Associations’s National Convention. Harshyne said the company received a boost at one of the shows when Major League Bowhunter set up their booth next to HUNTERRA, and soon after established a partnership.\nThe company has seen a significant increase in orders over the past year, Harshyne said. In fact, the company has continued to produce maps even as they drive cross country. The Airstream was designed as a mobile office, and is appropriately titled The Mobile Map Cave.\nHarshyne said he is excited to see where the company can grow now that he and his wife can focus on it full time, and relocating to the middle of their main client market."

        "prompt": "Big news in the world of food policy, farming and antibiotic use: Perdue Farms, the third-largest chicken producer in the United States, announced today that during the past decade it has ceased using most of the antibiotics that formerly propped up its chicken production.\nThere are caveats to that \"most,\" and I'll explain them. But it's important to say up front that this is a nationally significant move and looks like an industry-leading step.\ninjecting meat chickens with antibiotics while still in the shell.\nThose restrictions mean the company has eliminated most of the uses of antibiotics that public health campaigners have been concerned about since the 1970s, and has gone beyond current federal requirements for what can be done to meat chickens before they hatch. And while the impact probably can't be measured with precision as long as other firms continue to use antibiotics routinely, it seems likely that Perdue has taken an important step in reducing the amount of antibiotic resistance that comes off farms and causes human illness.\nThe company said it began its antibiotic reduction program 12 years ago. The trigger for today's announcement was completing the removal of antibiotic use from its hatcheries, which was a five-year project that ended this summer.\n\"When we started hearing from consumers that they were becoming concerned about the amount of antibiotics used to raise chickens they were buying, we were listening,\" company chairman Jim Perdue said at the DC briefing. \"Coupled with information coming from the USDA and FDA and other sources, we began to look critically at our practices. It wasn't easy...but we found along the way that we could raise healthy chickens with fewer antibiotics.\"\nRoutine antibiotic use in meat production – that is, giving meat animals small doses of antibiotics every day in food or water, to make them put on weight faster and to prevent disease from the conditions they live in – has been under scrutiny for decades. The first federal action addressing it happened just last December, when the FDA asked veterinary pharmaceutical manufacturers to relabel the antibiotics they make, so that \"growth promotion\" – that weight-gain use – would become an unapproved, technically illegal use of the drug.\nThe concern that lies behind routine animal antibiotic use is that most of the drugs used on farms are the same ones used against infections that humans develop. Bacteria in animals' guts or on their skin develop resistance to protect themselves; when the animals are slaughtered, or their manure washes or wafts off the farm property, the resistant bacteria go along too. When humans pick up those bacteria from meat or the environment, they can't be treated – because the drug needed to cure them is the same one that was used on the farm in the first place.\nThe \"ionophore exception\" is why the Perdue announcement and release today included words like \"fewer\" from Perdue himself, and statements like this from Dr. Bruce Stewart-Brown, Senior Vice President of Food Safety, Quality and Live Operations: “By no longer using any antibiotics in our hatcheries or any human antibiotics in feed, we’ve reached the point where 95 percent of our chickens never receive any human antibiotics, and the remainder receive them only for a few days when prescribed by a veterinarian.\"\nStewart-Brown said during the briefing that the company's ionophore use is also trending down, but wasn't willing to give figures. The only birds to receive the ionophores, he said, are the company's regular brand of chicken; neither the organic nor the \"no antibiotics ever\" lines do. However, he said, animals that get sick will be treated with antibiotics if the company's veterinarians think it is needed, but then will be sold under the regular brand.\nTo compensate for the lost effect of the antibiotics the company relinquished, Stewart-Brown said they also improved chickens' diets by removing animal byproducts and going to an all-vegetable feed of soybean meal and corn oil; using prebiotics and probiotics including \"oregano and yucca\" and \"yogurt type things\"; increasing the number of vaccinations chickens receive; and doubling down on cleaning chicken \"houses,\" the long sheds that can hold tens of thousands of broilers at a time.\n\"This doesn't mean we are done,\" he said. \"We constantly learn new things and try to evolve our program.\"\nCampaigners for reduced antibiotic use mostly supported the comprehensive moves.\nGail Hansen, a public health veterinarian with the Pew Charitable Trusts, told me: \"This is a lot of what we have been asking for, for six years, so it is pretty positive,\" adding that she would like to see the company be more specific about the amounts of ionophores it uses and about better husbandry practices that could help boost broiler chickens' immune systems.\nCaroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said: \"The amount of antibiotics used on the farm is simply not sustainable if we want to preserve their uses in human medicine. I hope Perdue's actions foreshadow changes across the industry, and embolden regulators to prohibit the misuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture.\"\nJonathan Kaplan, Natural Resources Defense Council: \"Jim Perdue [says]: '… human-approved antibiotics should not be used to boost production or in place of responsible animal husbandry or hatchery management.' We agree!... We’d like to hear more about how Perdue is verifying these accomplishments and hope the company will also publish its actual antibiotic use data.\"\nSusan Vaughn Grooters of Keep Antibiotics Working praised the moves but raised a concern about birds that are outside Perdue's system but feed into it: the great-grandparent and grandparent birds that",
        "baseline": " maintain the lines Perdue uses to create its broilers' parents.\n\"Reducing antibiotics use is laudable, but we won't fully address threats to human health until we're looking at the whole poultry production system, including breeders,\" she told me. \"Purdue mentioned that they don't own the grandparent breeding flocks that supply to them. Consumers should be concerned with this black box. Through purchasing specifications and breeder production agreements, Purdue could further drive down antibiotic use in food animal production by addressing that use.\"\nIn a follow-up interview, Stewart-Brown said: \"We are not in the genetics business, but one thing we are really clear on (with the breeding companies) is we believe it is very important they are breeding in such a way that the parents and the progeny from those parents are as hearty and capable. They understand, when we are buying their product, that we need birds that will be healthy enough not to need the help of antibiotics.\""

This became particularly clear last week, when Google released its latest financial statements. In 2014, Google said, it spent nearly $11 billion on big stuff like land and buildings and hardware. In other words, it spent more on the big stuff than Intel, the world's largest computer chip maker and a company whose capital spending was traditionally a high-water mark for tech businesses.\nWhile Intel spent about $10 billion on the property, massive manufacturing plants, and equipment needed to build all those chips, Google spent $11 billion expanding a very different kind of business. Yes, it may have spent money on equipment needed to manufacture things like phones and smart thermostats, but the main point here is that the company likely shells out far more on the data centers, computer servers, and networking equipment needed to operate its vast online empire.\nThe world, you see, has changed. Google's $11 billion is a wonderfully succinct symbol for an enormous shift in modern technology, a shift that will only get bigger in the years to come. What the Oracle of Omaha failed to realize is that in the future, the Googles and Microsofts will be among the biggest spenders, not the smallest. And together with Apple and Amazon, they will use such enormous spending to replace the very foundations of modern technology, pushing aside not only Intel, but also old-school computer makers such as Dell, HP, EMC, and others.\n\"What has happened in the last 10 years is that the players thought to have no capital expense are actually spending more than those, like Intel, that were held up as the most capital intense,\" says Horace Dediu, a tech financial analyst with a think tank called the Clayton Christensen Institute. \"As things move to the cloud, the effect is on Intel and HP and Dell and on the IT departments of the world—an entire power-base for how IT decisions are made.\"\nIn expanding their already vast internet empires, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple are spending unprecedented amounts on the data centers and hardware devices that underpin their online services. And as these internet giants push into cloud computing—offering services that let outside companies, developers, and individuals run software and store data without setting up their own machines—they're eating away at the market for PCs, computer servers, storage hardware, and other stuff sold by the likes of Dell and HP. In the long run, they may undermine even Intel's chip business.\nThe world isn't just moving its software onto cloud computing services. Increasingly, we're tapping into this online software from smartphones and other mobile devices—many built by Apple and Google—and typically, these mobile devices eschew chips from Intel in favor of designs from rival ARM. Intel still supplies many of chips that help drive online services inside data centers operated by the likes of Google and Microsoft, but this may change—with at least",

But maybe not.\"\nIn an effort to improve the efficiency of their data centers—and thus reduce costs—Google and Microsoft already design their own servers. Google even fashions its own networking gear. And chips are the next logical step. In years past, the top Wall Street minds—including Warren Buffett—frowned on such capital-intensive spending, saying that businesses were generally healthier if they kept cap-ex low. But at least for a select few companies, the opposite is now true. After all, these are the companies that will run the future. To do that, you need land and buildings and hardware—in spades."

We've found that refugees really want to work, so with training and an understanding of the workplace, they will be excellent employees.\"\nCamp I Am Special serves children and adults with disabilities in seven week-long overnight-camp sessions where each camper is paired one-on-one with a high-school buddy who helps with everything the camper does.The program is as popular with volunteers as it is with participants and has a waiting list of 150 volunteers.\nMany of those helped by Catholic Charities' Refugee Resettlement Program have limited English skills and employment histories, so ESL classes and help finding jobs is essential. Others have experienced emotional trauma, torture, the loss of family members or long years in refugee camps, making it necessary to \"tread lightly\" with an understanding heart.\n\"We have a very diverse staff of 62 employees in Jacksonville, with some members coming here as refugees themselves,\" Hopkins said. \"They have an immediate rapport with new arrivals, especially those from their home countries.\"\nRefugees aren't the only people having a difficult time finding employment, which is why Catholic Charities also offers a Workforce Development program.\n\"Five years ago, we were seeing many who had lost jobs and wanted desperately to get back to work,\" Hopkins said. \"With a three-year start-up grant from the Jessie Ball DuPont Fund, we have helped 937 people in the last five years, with 411 gaining employment.\"\nThe weeklong program offers job readiness classes, help with resume-writing and interviewing, as well as a closet filled with clothes appropriate for job interviews. Then, for up to four months afterward, participants can come back to the center to use the computers, get help with cover letters and apply for jobs.\n\"We also help with some of the barriers to employment — arrange child care, provide bus passes and appropriate clothing,\" Hopkins said. \"And we work with the Family Foundation to provide mental health counseling for those who are not yet ready to work.\n\"The main point with all our programs is that we treat each participant as an individual, showing compassion and love, and listening to what they have to say. These are individuals and a one-size-fits-all approach simply won't work.\"\nCatholic Charities' Immigration and Legalization program works with immigrants of all types, not just refugees. The program has been accredited for more than 10 years by the Council on Accreditation — only nine organizations in Jacksonville have that accreditation — and by the Department of Justice, so its staff can do the work that an immigration attorney would do. In the past year, the program has helped 512 documented immigrants with their paperwork.\nHigh on the list of programs that everyone — participants and staff alike — loves is Camp I Am Special, also ACA accredited for children and adults with disabilities. The camp serves those ages five through 65 in seven weeklong overnight-camp sessions, during which each participant is paired one-on-one with a high-school buddy who helps with absolutely everything.\n\"This has been going on for 34 years with an incredible amount of success,\" Hopkins said. \"I was actually a volunteer for four summers while I was in high school and so was my brother. It was there that he learned to have a love for these special children. He went on to medical school to become a pediatrician with a specialty in autism, and it's all because of volunteering at Camp I Am Special. It's such a wonderful experience that earlier volunteers are now doctors, nurses and lead nonprofits. Right now, there is a volunteer waiting list with 150 names on it.\"\nResponse from the community has been generous as well. When the camp's 50-year-old swimming pool was finally declared unusable, $900,000 was raised and a new pool, designed by Auld & White, is scheduled to open in December.\nBecause Catholic Charities is",

He ran the show with an iron fist, he was the guy who kept the vultures away.\n'But when Wendy saw the photos of him and Sharina last week on the Daily Mail going out for dinner and her driving around in a Ferrari she was furious.\n'That's what tipped her over the edge, she was like, \"he's gotta go\". She now wants him out of her life completely, she's given him 48 hours to clear his office and clear his belongings out of the house.\nA day after DailyMail.com published photos of the new Ferrari that Hunter gifted Hudson, it was loaded onto a truck and taken away.\nA Ferrari dealership from Greenwich, Connecticut, picked the golden car up, as two men who appear to be helpers for Hunter looked on.\nHunter's statement on Tuesday read: '28 years ago I met an amazing woman: Wendy Williams. At the time, I didn't realize that she would not only become my wife, but would also change the face of entertainment and the world.\n'I have dedicated most of our lives to the business empire that is Wendy Williams Hunter, a person that I truly love and respect unconditionally.\nI am not proud of my recent actions and take full accountability and apologize to my wife, my family and her amazing fans. I am going through a time of self-reflection and am trying to right some wrongs.\n'No matter what the outcome is or what the future holds, we are still The Hunter Family and I will continue to work with and fully support my wife in this business and through any and all obstacles she may face living her new life of sobriety, while I also work on mine.\nOn Monday, Wendy kicked off her Hot Topics segment by revealing she was just a few days away from moving out the sober living facility she has called home for the past few weeks, and is ready to start a new life for herself and her son Kevin Jr. - the son she shares with Hunter.\nDailyMail.com exclusively revealed in early March the TV host had been living in the sober home in Queens, New York, to battle an addiction to alcohol and prescription pills, her downward spiral sparked by learning Hunter was still seeing Hudson.\nMeanwhile, Hunter has been spending time with Hudson, who recently gave birth, at a hideaway in Edgewater, New Jersey.\nThe two seem to be living the high life, going out for dinner dates and driving new luxury vehicles.\nHunter was seen driving a new maroon convertible Rolls-Royce last Saturday to pick up Hudson and take her out to dinner, with the massage therapist proudly showing off her post baby pooch.\nThe 33-year-old, whose hair was freshly curled, carried a $5,200 quilted Chanel purse while wearing a chunky diamond chain necklace and diamond studs.\nWhile Hunter treated his baby mama to a Ferrari, he seems to have also treated himself to new cars, including the luxury Rolls-Royce.\nHudson was seen driving her new sports car last Monday, exiting the flashy vehicle in a $1,260 Thom Browne tracksuit that showed off her post-baby body.\nAnd Kevin has spared no expense on his own duds as well, seen one day in a $1,500 Fendi vest, $490 Fendi hat, $770 Fendi pants and $515 Fendi sunglasses.\nThe couple have been hiding out in New Jersey weeks after Hudson was secreted away to Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia to give birth in order to avoid media attention.\nHunter has been seen at the secret hideaway chauffeuring Sharina around.\nKevin was served with divorce papers from Wendy last Thursday morning at the TV studio, according to TMZ.\nExtra security was hired in case Kevin, known to have a temper, got enraged on set.

During the time away from hosting her show, Williams' drinking - coupled with powerful pain medication - proved a potent cocktail. Williams, who has a history of drug addiction, became hooked.\nAfter returning from rehab in Florida, Williams began living in a sober home in Queens, which is situated above a barbershop in an unassuming red brick building in Long Island City.\nBut when news broke that Hudson had given birth to a little girl in late March, she checked herself out of her sober living home and started drinking - eventually being found by her team who took her to the hospital to sober up.\nIt's",

But after the visitor, dubbed the “Poe Toaster,” failed to appear two years in a row, Poe fans are planning one last vigil this week before calling an end to the annual Jan. 19 tradition.\nThe gothic master’s tales of the macabre still connect with readers more than 200 years after his birth, including his most famous poem, “The Raven,” and short stories including “The Tell-Tale Heart” and “The Pit and the Pendulum.” Poe’s “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” is considered the first modern detective story.\nPoe House and Museum Curator Jeff Jerome, who has kept watch for the “Poe Toaster” since 1978, believes that it’s Poe’s suffering and his lifelong dream to be a poet that people still relate to. While the midnight tribute has a touch of the theatrical, it’s also an honest expression, Jerome said. Wherever Jerome travels in the world, he said when people find out what he does, they want to know whether the “Poe Toaster” is real.\nPoe lived for a time in Baltimore, but died in 1849 at age 40 after collapsing in a tavern during a visit to the city years later. He",

After the “Poe Toaster” failed to show in 2010, last year’s vigil attracted impostors, including a man who arrived in a limo as well as a few women.\nThe visitor has left notes on occasion. A few indicated that the tradition passed to a new generation after the death of the original “Poe Toaster” in the late 1990s, and some even mentioned politics and sports. Those notes make it even more frustrating for Jerome that there has been no message explaining the absence."

The two need to harmonize well together in a perfect combination. It is important that we understand the DNA of both cuisines,” explains Peru’s star chef of the restaurant “Maido” in Lima, a Nikkei concept which ranked seventh in the San Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurants 2018.\nFor the new menu at MGM Cotai’s signature Nikkei restaurant, Aji, Tsumura, widely known as Chef Micha, works with his team, led by Chef Edwin Guzman Navarro and Manager Alexandre Santos.\nTheir goal is to elevate the original menu to another level and feature their best efforts and creativity. Additional ingredients from Peru are imported to make the taste profile more complex. The result is an explosion of well-balanced flavors and aesthetics that surprises the senses.\nUmami takes center stage for creations like Causa: mashed potato filled with yellow chilli, king crab, and salmon roe layered on a bed of black rice cracker.\nFor lovers of beef tartar, Aji’s version of the raw beef delight is enhanced with sea urchin, quail egg, and truffle chapla.\nMushroom fanatics will be thrilled by mushroom, shiitake, enoki and king oyster mushroom in broth.\nLastly, the Rocoto, a dessert filled with coconut, cinnamon foam, chocolate praline and peanut ice cream, sweetens the palate with its diverse textures, making it the perfect conclusion to a rich meal characterized by sophisticated combinations and innovative artistry.\nAfter the tasting, the Times sat down with the Nikkei chefs for a conversation.\nMacau Daily Times (MDT) – How do you work with Chef Edwin?\nChef Mitsuharu Tsumura (MT) – I communicate constantly with Edwin. For the first few months of the first year, I was more involved creatively. Now I give ideas, but I would say that 80 or 90 percent of the job is done by [Chefs] Edwin and Aldo. Actually, they come up with ideas and they ask me, “what do you think about this?” And we take the ideas from there. Edwin and Aldo know what kind of flavors I like. I also give him ideas. So it’s team work, but it’s mostly executed by Aldo and Edwin.\nMDT – You talk through Facetime?\nEdwin has always been a very talented and creative chef. He worked with me in Maido. He won the best young chef [award] in Peru, the contest. Edwin has really developed a good relationship with everybody in the hotel, with the team, and outside the hotel. Also in Hong Kong. He is very easy going. When I came this time, I was surprised because everybody knows him and he knows everybody. I feel proud and very happy because before coming here, it was a challenge, but I think he has done very well and engaged with the people.\nMDT – Can you talk about your experience in Macau?\nChef Edwin Guzman Navarro (EGN) – It was a challenge when Mitsuharu made the decision to choose myself and Aldo to come to Macau and develop the concept here in China. It was a challenge looking for products similar to the Peruvian ones and starting to cook with people who don’t know anything about your cuisine and your flavors. But I can say the first year was very good also. We were tired but enjoyed the work.\nMDT – How do you overcome the problem of importing products?\nEGN – When the Hong Kong- Macau-Zhuhai Bridge was finished, we were thinking maybe the problem can be fixed because half of the products [can be found] in Hong Kong, but delivery is not easy. We have some ingredients flown directly from Peru, but it’s very expensive.\nPeruvian cuisine is developing in Asia, more in Hong Kong than in Macau, and the products are going to Hong Kong first and then sent to other places. We are still trying to find new suppliers.\nMDT – And ingredients from Japan?\nEGN – I went with Mitsuharu to Japan and tried the food there. I saw the ingredients, but was not very familiar with all of them. Actually, we always ask Mitsuharu how we should cook with those products that we never saw in our life.\nMDT – What about the kitchen, is it to your liking?\nMT – It’s a dream kitchen. I said when I open this restaurant in Macau, it has to be the kitchen of my dreams. [MGM] hired a designer and everything, but I want to design it myself. So, I went back to Peru and I drew it there. I want this station here, pastry there, etc. Plunger here, walks here. So, it’s not a typical kitchen, it has many stations. It’s like a fish bowl.\nMDT – Is the new menu an elevation of the previous menu?\nMT – We try to make something special for our guests. Engawa, for example, is top quality and a precious part of the fish, but most people don’t know what it is.\nWhen I first went to Japan I didn’t know about it because in Peru, we don’t use it; we throw it away because it’s hard [to cook with]. But now they’re using it. Some 17 years ago or so, my boss in Japan said, “Okay cut the fish.” I cut the fish and left the Engawa and he got mad because I threw it away. “Where’s the Engawa? Why not use that? That is the most expensive part of the fish. That’s worth the same amount as the whole fish,” he added. I’m never going to forget that. If you don’t go very well into the bone of the fish, you can lose half of the Engawa. These tough parts of the fish are the best parts for cooking… because they’re very hard when they are raw, but they are very tender when they are cooked.\nMDT – Who are the clients?\nAlexandre Santos (AS) – Expat and local Chinese community. They accept the food but it is very new for them. You need to really take an effort to explain what the dish is. After opening up the menu, we try our best to go to the table and start to explain.\nMT – I was happy to hear that 80 percent or more of the customers of Aji are locals.\nAS – In the beginning it was like the ‘curiosity stage’ of the whole hotel. It was the first Peruvian and then Nikkei Restaurant in Macau and it was challenging then. […] I got a chance to go to Peru almost a year and a half ago. Chef Micha took me out to many different places, like even fish markets, a French market and different restaurants with different types of cuisine and this overcame a lot of basic challenges, for example, how we can explain the dishes to the guests.\nMDT – Chef Micha, what is your goal for the future?\nMT – I take life day-by-day. I don’t like to plan, but I have to plan sometimes because that’s the way my work is. Many people think I’m very organized, but I am not. When I wake up every day, I try to make my day perfect. But when I plan something too much, it doesn’t work. That has happened to me. So the best things in my life have happened without planning. So, I really don’t know what I’m going to do. One of the things I know I’m going to do is that I’m going to close my restaurant in Lima. Maido is going to close in approximately three or four more years.\nMy concept in Chile and China are basically the only two concepts that are this elaborate. What I open in the future will be very casual. I am not looking to be in a ranking, just [to make] good food at a good price. I want to make my food more democratic. I want to open more concepts where everybody can go. That is happiness. We can make tasty food without it being so expensive. The future of food is informality. Do whatever you want.

That was 20 years ago. I said, “Where are you from?” “Macau.” “Where’s Macau?” Macau was not like [it is] now 20 years ago, so he talked about gambling. He said, “We have casinos there and the Portuguese influence and this is Macau.” So, from that time I always remembered Macau in that way and said, someday I’m going to go."

Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact. After interviewing and examining him, I recapped why he had been hospitalized and explained that hospitalized for a few more days while we monitored his liver function.\nHere was a patient with a damaged liver and little mystery about what had caused it, and yet here he was, with questions about… mold?\nThis was not the first—and certainly won’t be the last—patient to ask about mold. My patients have often wondered aloud whether mold is causing their breathing troubles, sinus congestion, overwhelming fatigue, and so on. Ultimately, I told this patient the same thing I told all the others: Mold exposure was not responsible for your health problems.\nMold worries are generally unfounded. There is no evidence that otherwise healthy individuals have any reason to fear falling ill from building mold, mold inhalation, or any other type of exposure to so-called toxic mold (PDF). Even when it comes to water-damaged buildings, any medically proven associations with health issues have come with long-term occupational exposures—not household exposures.\nIf you need more assurance, look no further than a study that examined residents of post-Katrina New Orleans: It didn’t find any increased risk of adverse respiratory effects from water-damaged buildings. This helps explain why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) doesn’t recommend routine mold testing in households, instead suggesting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) guide to mold control to ensure indoor air quality in high moisture environments.\nThat said, mold can cause health problems in certain populations—but typically, it only seriously affects patients who have underlying health conditions. Specifically, immunocompromised patients could be at risk of systemic fungal infections, and patients prone to allergic rhinitis or allergic asthma could have responses to inhaled mold.\nThere are skin and blood-testing methods available to determine whether patients truly have mold allergies or not. Additionally, anybody who has had long-term occupational exposure to mold could develop a rare disease known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which affects lung function. But beyond these medically established connections to mold exposure and medical illnesses, much of the rest is internet lore.\nSo, unless you’re in one of those rare categories, you don’t have anything to fear about exposure—and yet mold hysteria is fairly widespread. Why?\nThe answer is a depressing case study in internet-era medical misinformation, rumor-mongering, and irresponsible online doctoring. In short, some irresponsible people are drumming up fears about mold and then profiting off of those fears. These profits come at the expense of patients like mine who use these theories as scapegoats, failing to understand and tackle the real medical issues at hand.\nOn the surface, there certainly appears to be a wealth of online information about the supposedly harmful effects of mold exposure. A quick Google search of “mold” and “fatigue” will draw your attention to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).\nProponents of CFS justify the condition on the basis of one very flawed study that drew an association between mold and the syndrome, relying entirely on “urine mycotoxin” data—or the levels of fungal metabolites in urine. Not long the paper was published, the CDC issued a statement on the lack of clinical validity of urine mycotoxin tests, effectively invalidating its results.\nWhen contacted for comment, Brewer said that he relies on the clinical picture and symptoms to diagnose CFS, based on the CDC’s 1994 case definition. He still offers urine mycotoxin testing to his patients, despite the CDC’s own website clearly stating that there is no “lab test or biomarker” for CFS and no single identifiable cause.\nThe mold-CFS internet monster is nothing compared to the “Surviving Mold” empire created by Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker. Shoemaker’s website discusses mold-induced chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS) ad nauseum. This disease encompasses a gamut of vague symptomatology, defined as “an acute and chronic, systemic inflammatory response syndrome” in response to mold, bacteria, and other “pro-inflammatory” exposures. The scientific evidence to back up CIRS is severely lacking, and if you search for more details on specific clinical descriptors, you will end up empty-handed.\nPerhaps inevitably, Shoemaker offers to train (for a fee) other physicians with his “Shoemaker Protocol,” a program to help them detect and treat CIRS. Online memberships are offered for all website visitors, ranging in price from $19.50 per month to $175 for a 12-month subscription. The memberships offer screening tools, email consultations with Shoemaker, and other “Surviving Mold” materials.\nDespite the fact that Shoemaker has been out of clinical practice since 2013 and has come under fire by both his state medical board and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for unregulated online portal and practice methods, the website is still thriving and propagating myths that spread to other “alternative health” websites.\nWhen asked for comment, Shoemaker told The Daily Beast “you have your facts wrong,” and declined to reply to further emails.\nIf any myth is more pervasive than that of toxic mold and systemic illness, it is the earlier mentioned water-damaged buildings and “mycotoxicosis” legend. Proponents of mycotoxicosis suggest that mold in such buildings can trigger inflammatory processes that lead to immunologic changes and a gamut of symptoms—ranging from neurological complaints to pulmonary issues. The study of post-Katrina New Orleans residents should have debunked all of this, but there still is a wealth of false information online about water-damaged buildings and the illnesses they allegedly cause.\nHere, one of the biggest figures is a Dr. William Rea, who came under fire from the Texas medical board for multiple complaints, including using “pseudoscientific test methods,” offering inaccurate diagnoses, providing inappropriate treatments, practicing",
        "baseline": " in an area beyond his expertise, and failing to fully disclose his practice approach with his patients. In the wake of a settlement he reached with the board in Texas, Rea was ordered to modify his patient consent forms to note that his therapies have not been therapeutically proven and are not FDA-approved.\nBut remarkably, Rea’s Environmental Health Center is still open in Dallas, billing itself as a “complete testing and treatment facility for chemically-sensitive adults and children.” Rea is actually only board certified in cardiovascular and general surgery. Requests for comment from Rea went unanswered.\nThe bottom line: Don’t believe the hype. There’s a very real reason why doctors caution patients about information available on the internet. People who might be susceptible to mold-related health effects are usually only vulnerable because of underlying health conditions, so this is a case of the chicken before the egg—or in this case, the patient before the mold."

        "prompt": "Paleo diets avoid foods that came with modern agriculture.\n1 What is the Paleo Diet?\n4 Does the Paleo Diet Eliminate Healthy Foods Like Brown Rice?\nYou might not be a caveman, but proponents claim it's advantageous to eat like one. This means sticking to foods that were available to your Paleolithic ancestors during a prehistoric era that ended about 15,000 years ago. While Loren Cordain, author of \"The Paleo Diet,\" is perhaps one of the most well-known proponents of this way of eating, you can find slightly different types of paleo diets.\nLoren Cordain recommends avoiding dairy, eggs, grains and legumes and focusing on lean meat, fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts and seeds. Cordain claims the paleo people ate a relatively low-carbohydrate diet, so his approach places emphasis on lean meats above all. On the other hand, Arthur De Vany, author of \"The New Evolution Diet,\" claims that your paleo ancestors mainly foraged for plants and hunted meat when they could. His paleo-style diet places emphasis on vegetables and fruit, not meat. He does not exclude starchy vegetables, and he recommends eating at least 25 percent of your vegetables raw.\nIf you cringe at the thought of avoiding dairy and eggs, perhaps Mark Sisson, author of \"The Primal Blueprint,\" has the diet for you. Although he claims your paleo ancestors thrived on a plant-based diet, he doesn't exclude dairy and eggs. Sisson recommends choosing raw, grass-fed or fermented dairy products, but he recommends having fruits and vegetables make up the bulk of your diet. In addition, Sisson recommends wild-caught fish and grass-fed meat. He, too, recommends avoiding grains, legumes, processed oils and table sugar.\nRobb Wolf, author of \"The Paleo Solution,\" has similar recommendations to Loren Cordain. However, he takes a slightly different approach when it comes to meat. Wolf doesn't seem to think animal fat is a major problem and recommends meat such as pork chops, bacon and fatty cuts of steak that you'd normally avoid on other paleo-style diets. Wolf emphasizes grass-",
        "baseline": "fed meat and wild game meat, which he says is naturally leaner than commercial meat. Wolf also recommends starchy vegetables, which Cordain places on the no-no list.\nThere's no one way to apply paleo principles to your eating habits. However, all approaches seem to agree that it's better to eat as naturally as possible and avoid junk food, processed food and table sugar. Researchers are finding that paleo diets may offer potential benefits. A small randomized study found that adhering to a paleo diet for three months improved blood sugar control and cardiovascular risk factors in participants with Type 2 diabetes. The results were published in the journal \"Cardiovascular Diabetology\" in July 2009.\nFroek, Barbara. \"Alternatives to Cordain's Paleo Diet.\" Healthy Eating | SF Gate, http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/alternatives-cordains-paleo-diet-11384.html.

The group many thought would struggle to come close to last year's total of six wins. The team that some ranked at the bottom of the NFL entering the season.\nAs unlikely as it seemed a few months ago, or even just a few days ago, Rex Ryan's bunch has made a firm statement as it heads into the bye-week break.

        "prompt": "Trump on Charlottesville - stated the ‘obvious’ or is he ‘emotionally with KKK’?\nUS President Donald Trump has denounced the violence that erupted on Saturday in the city of Charlottesville, Virginia, saying both the far right and the left are to blame for the bloody clashes.\nHe was initially criticized for not explicitly condemning white supremacists rallying in Charlottesville.\nTrump also questioned the mounting campaign against Confederate monuments, saying that it could lead the US down a slippery slope and warned statues of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington could be the next to fall if the trend continues.\nUS mainstream media have been quick to paint Trump as a sympathizer of neo-Nazis and white supremacists.\n“I think they were just looking for any opportunity to fault him for saying what was obvious to anybody who watched that footage – which was there was violence coming from both sides,” Jim Jatras told RT.\n“Let’s be honest, for months in this country we’ve had this so-called Antifa, the so-called anti-fascist who frankly are fascists themselves, who use these Stormtrooper tactics to attack violently people they disagree with. They call them ‘racists’ even if they are not racists. You have people who can’t speak on college campuses – they’ll attack you if you wear a “Make America great again” hat and they’ve been doing it with impunity,” he added.\nAccording to the former diplomat, Trump was the right to call them out. “Of course he’s going to denounce, and rightly so, people who are in fact Nazis or Klansmen or things of their sort. But let’s not pretend that these people in black with the masks and the clubs are innocent,” he said.\nTrump has faced mounting pressure from lawmakers and the media to condemn the far right in stronger terms. However, the President said both sides of the conflict are to blame because “it has the virtue of being true,” Jatras said.\n“Where is the Justice Department Task Force, the civil rights Task Force looking into Antifa, and where their funding is coming from, and who is directing their violent activities. That side of the ledger is not shown. Frankly, I think the Republicans are just as complicit in this as the Democrats,” he added.\nFollowing the Charlottesville clashes, some American cities rushed to remove Confederate-era monuments. According to Brian Becker, these statues commemorate people who took up arms against the US government in defense on slavery.\n“These have been longstanding symbols of white supremacy and the defense of Jim Crow and Apartheid in America,” he told RT.\n“This would be like having a monument in Russia to Nazi Germany – that is what this means. These are the people who took up arms against the US government in defense of the system of slavery. Black people should not be forced to bow and walk in front of these monuments that are testimonials and celebration of their enslavement,” Becker continued.\n“The Washington Monument, the [Thomas] Jefferson Memorial, which are also monuments of slaveholders – that is not the point – these monuments have been built not as a national historical thing – it is about the white supremacy movement erecting them at the times in American history in the 1890’s and in the early 1920’s and right before that, when there was an effort to push back against black freedom,” he said.\nJohn Griffing, investigative reporter: Clearly both sides [of the clash in Charlottesville] were spurring for a fight. These were two very highly charged energized groups of people, but one had a permit to be there, and the other group did not have a permit to be there. And the police stood by, stood down, if you will, and allowed this violence to take place, and did not intervene. That is their dereliction of duty.\n“Look",

So finally the pressure mounted and he read a prepared statement, and then he did his deed,” Becker continued.\n“But what we saw today was the real Donald Trump, and he is really angry at the left. The people who came out and provided protection and security from this organization,” said analyst.\n“They are America’s terrorists. 10,000 black people have been lynched in America – the KKK celebrated that.

But is it?\nBy reading between the lines, we often find the story within the story. It's called the hidden agenda, the gray area. The law then becomes more elastic, requiring additional scrutiny. Thus, in order to decipher the invisible ink, critical thought requires viewing circumstance within the spirit of the law.\nI don't need to dissect the issues to formulate an opinion regarding this argument. There is absolutely no ambiguity in my analysis. The Islamists' intent to build this mosque adjacent to ground zero is an abomination of good will, sensitivity and judgment. It is offensive and obtrusive to the most basic of sensibilities.\nDo we not remember what happened there on Sept. 11, 2001? Should we believe that under the pretext of tolerance we could ostensibly eradicate the scars of 9/11? What about the sensibilities of the exponential numbers of family, friends, and friends of friends who lost someone? How about the 360 firefighters who lost their lives? Does a mosque solemnize their slaughter?\nA place is made sacred because it was visited by the miraculous or the transcendent such as Fatima or by the presence there of great nobility and sacrifice such as Normandy or by the blood of martyrs and the suffering of the innocent such as ground zero.\nGround zero is hallowed ground. It belongs to those who suffered and died there. We are obliged to preserve the dignity and memory of the place, never allowing it to be forgotten, trivialized or misappropriated.\nWe are prisoners of the 1st Amendment. Thus, it's their right to build the mosque even though it is morally offensive for them to do so. Even President Obama sanctioned the rights of Islam under the guise of freedom of worship. How noble. Too bad he didn't have the courage to do some peaceful proselytizing and remind Islam of their lack of religious tolerance.\nFreedom of worship is not specific to just Americans. It is a basic human right, and where it lacks protection there is serious injustice. How many churches or synagogues are allowed in Mecca?\nI am tired of being lectured to by Mayor Bloomberg and his progressive supporters regarding my lack of religious tolerance and support for the Constitution. At 22 I took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, then picked up a rifle and walked the walk. What did they do? This is not an issue of intolerance or bigotry.

The space should include a synagogue and a church so it will truly be interfaith. Many Islamic intellectuals do not support this project, and their moderation is encouraging.\"\nI ask myself, what is the right thing to do? Where lies the chance to be noble? Both sides of the issue should ponder this question. The Constitution must be honored, and the noble nature of America must ascend and allow this project to go forward.\nHowever, nobility is universal among all righteous individuals; it is neither culturally relevant nor situational. Thus Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf must likewise ascend the hierarchy of nobility and build his mosque somewhere else.\nWhen this happens we will know peace."

A well-lit display case featured a large array of desserts, including carrot cake, chocolate cake and assorted Greek pastries. They all looked tempting.\nTo the left past the dessert display is a larger, better appointed dining room. Mauve, tufted, demi-lune booths looked fit for royalty. Because there were seven in our party, we were at a large table set down the center of the room.\nMany customers sitting in the first dining room appeared to be pizza-directed, and the menu is heavily weighted on that front. Pies range from the basics to build your own, with a long list of toppings from sun-dried tomatoes, bacon, broccoli and eggplant to cherry peppers, jalapeños and pineapple. Specialty pizzas included the likes of Philly cheese steak, pesto, clams casino, potato and moussaka. The list is long.\nIf the pizza list was daunting, the entrée selection nearly overwhelmed. The menu takes up five large, full pages, plus an insert with daily specials. All entrées are served with soup or salad and a choice of grinder rolls, plain or toasted with garlic. Service was excellent.\nWe started with a large order of whole belly clams to pass and share. They turned out to be predominately strips, helped by a few bellies. The latter were on the small side, but enjoyable nonetheless. Broiled seafood such as salmon, sole, shrimp and scallops came in various disguises, with a lengthy array of pastas available on the sides.\nMost of us ordered salads with assorted dressings. The greens were crisp, fresh and decorated with sliced cucumbers, grape tomatoes and shredded carrots. I ordered the soup du jour, pasta fagiole. The tomato based broth, much thicker than expected, contained little pasta, but lots of chopped celery, carrots and a few beans.\nSeveral dishes could be ordered two different ways. Chicken or veal could be had finished with piccata, francaise, Marsala or Parmesan sauces. All portions were quite generous and could be ordered with ziti, shells or spaghetti. The chicken piccata had a lemon and white wine coating studded with tangy capers. The sauce contained a thickener, probably cornstarch or flour, but was not discernable by taste.\nFrom the list of specials, veal osso bucco minus the bones offered a window into what the kitchen could do. Slowly braised chunks of veal mixed with tomatoes and garlic languished in yet another gravy, with fettuccine served as a side. Although basically an Italian dish, this sauce had hints of cinnamon similar to what might be found in Greek moussaka.\nShrimp scampi exemplified the generosity of the portions. Loads of pasta swirled beneath jumbo shrimp. Everything, including sautéed garlic and onions, was tossed in a light lemon sauce. Though not the traditional Italian version with olive oil, garlic and parsley, it was very satisfying.\nIt’s not often we see roast leg of lamb on local menus. Thick meaty slices, evidence again of slow braising, were so tender they just about fell off the fork. Small browned, roasted potatoes and a combo of baby carrots, green and yellow wax beans paired nicely with the lamb. It was a hearty platter.\nThe menfolk dove into their respective plates of chicken or veal parmigiana dishes. The breaded and fried cutlets were topped with good mozzarella cheese and a fine tomato sauce. Their individual pasta picks came with a well-balanced red sauce blanketing the plate.

On the other end of the scale, student populations in the 20 districts that lost the most librarians in the same time comprised 78% students of color.\nIn other words, while U.S. employment rates are back up in the wake of the Great Recession, the public school librarian sector has not rebounded, and the nation's collective failure to rebuild its public information infrastructure is hitting minorities the hardest.\nSome states suffered a more dramatic loss than the average. The number of librarians employed across Florida’s 67 school districts has dropped by 27% since just 2005, according to a 2017 Herald Tribune article, leaving several districts without any librarians at all. In replacement, the Herald Tribune argues, paraprofessionals run libraries as media aides — a position that requires just a high school diploma and a certification, and which starts at $14.60 an hour. Librarians with masters' degrees, however, are often the first to go when budgets need to be cut.\nEducation Week's articles also argues that librarian's roles are being replaced by other, less qualified job titles: As public school librarians dwindled by 20%, schools saw an 11% rise in counselors, 19% boost in instructional aides, and a full 28% more school administrators. Hopefully, some of those unemployed librarians were able to secure a second career in an administration position. Disputing this viewpoint, however, is Keith Curry Lance's School Library Journal analysis, which notes that public school library support staff have been cut or otherwise stopped working at a rate even faster than that of librarians: Support staff have dropped from more than 46,000 to fewer than 26",
        "baseline": ",000, a loss of nearly 45 percent during the same time period librarians dropped nearly 20 percent. Hopefully, some of those unemployed librarians were able to secure a second career in an administration position.\nWhile the direct impact of the drop in school librarians can be tough to pinpoint with data, several recent studies have indicated that students suffer academically as a result: One nationwide study published in 2011 found signs that states' 4th grade reading scores dropped in correlation with their loss of librarians. A 2012 Colorado-specific study from the same researchers then followed up, finding a similar correlation in the opposite direction: \"Schools that either maintained or gained an endorsed librarian between 2005 and 2011 tended to have more students scoring advanced in reading in 2011 and to have increased their performance more than schools that either lost their librarians or never had one,\" that study holds.\n\"You get what you pay for,\" Researcher Keith Lance told the Herald Tribune in 2017."

        "prompt": "Jewel Samad/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Melody C. Barnes preparing to play golf with President Obama on Sunday in Fort Belvoir, Va.\nMelody C. Barnes, a White House aide, broke through President Obama’s green ceiling Sunday afternoon.\nMs. Barnes, the president’s chief domestic policy adviser, became the first woman to play a round of golf with Mr. Obama since he tee’d off his presidency in January. The milestone is noteworthy as Mr. Obama has come under criticism recently for hosting a basketball game earlier this month for members of his cabinet and congress that included no women (“Bunk,” Mr. Obama told NBC in an interview last week when asked about the controversy over the estrogen-free game).\nShortly after 1 p.m. on a crisp and sunny fall afternoon, Mr. Obama and Ms. Barnes took to the links at the U.S Army’s Fort Belvoir in Virginia. The president wore a black short-sleeve shirt while Ms. Barnes donned a baseball cap and a dark long-sleeve shirt, according to a White House pool report prepared by Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun-Times.\nIt was not immediately known what Mr. Obama and Ms. Barnes shot on Sunday.\nThis story is “Bunk”! Having a slow news day, New York Times?\nWhen it came to having women in the inner circle, Obama talks a good game but W walked it where O merely talks it.\nWho cares? I like to play golf with the guys just to be a guy… talk sports, have a beer, tell off-color jokes. The President (any president) has to spend all day being PC and inclusive with the pressure of providing for a nation of people, fighting two wars, and dealing with global crises. Let the guy play some basketball with the guys or pick his Sunday foursome with whomever he wants. Yeesh… this is NOT news.\nI thought the Silly Season ended on Labor Day.\nI hope she didn’t “let him” win!\nI think Obama has long since proved his bona fides as a strong feminist.\nBut does the absurd media coverage the all-male basketball game has received mean that every time Obama moves a muscle, it wlll be scrutinized for politically correctness according to extreme feminists???\nWell, I am certainly confident that anyone who considers the all-male basketball game to be serious evidence of Obama’s sexism would never condone a bunch of women getting together without a male present .\nWhat is this, cable? I read the Times to get away from this silliness.\nSeriously? Who cares who he plays golf with? Who cares what kind of clothes he or his guest was wearing? You would think the New York Times would have more to report on with two wars going on and Obama’s rating in the toilet.\nI’ve always been a tomboy…sports fan, more comfortable hanging with the guys. I totally understand the bond amongst men, often centered around beer, sports, cigars (i.e. fun stuff!). It’s a wonderful thing, just like the unique bond amongst women. The problem arises when work and important decisions are made during these all-male activities, whether intentional or not. I don’t know what to say ladies…take up golf I suppose.\nUnbelievable. This is “political correctness” without common sense. Dangerous.\nI am ok if there are baby showers were just women are invited, I am ok if there are sports team only for girls, I am ok if there are bathrooms only for women, and I am ok if the President chooses to play sports with men. People can read way too much into things, and forget context, common sense, perspective and also a bit of humor.\nHonestly, if the original story had not been on the front page, I would have thought it was a story from The Onion. I guess when the media is on a quest to find fault with someone, all areas are open.\nShouldn’t Obama first decide about troops in Afghainstan before he takes time off to play golf?\nmy father made me take golf lessons during junior high school and high school – he said it was for my future. he was right… once the office found out that i played golf, i was invited to play with the “guys.” it’s true… a lot of work issues are discussed during a game – i don’t think it’s intentional but it happens.\nYeah, John Drew, just like it’s a lot easier to be a right wing Christian if you don’t apply all those silly principles to your own life–you know, the ones about feeding the poor, loving your neighbor, and all that nonesense.\nOh, puh-leeeze. Is there really nothing else to talk about?\nMany times men are establishing relationships that further their careers when they get togther in activites such as these. Decisions are often made in such settings. If the all male club is sustained, women are put at a disadvantage. The people invited to such events are often the real inner circle. When women are excluded, they are put at a disadvantage.\nIf HRC had been elected president, how would men like it if she only invited women to all social functions and shut out men? My question is hypothetical since HRC did not win, but it would be interesting to see men’s reactions to such a scenario.\nFor all of Obama’s talk, I do think he harbors sexist attitudes.\n“When it came to having women in the inner circle, Obama talks a good game but W walked it where O merely talks it.\nIn response to Liz: If you are playing golf with people who are talking about work you aren’t really playing golf.\nFirst of all, obviously the president and his staff seems to have realized that this is a problem. Why else, all of a sudden, Melody Barnes is playing golf with him?\nSecond, to all those people dismissing this story: it’s not “just” a basketball game. Things like these might seem harmless on the surface, but can actually have a deleterious effect on women’s upward movement in the workplace. It is exactly these kinds of informal, male networks that can give men the edge, when it comes time for performance reviews, bonuses, allocation of juicy assignments, promotions, etc.\nThis doesn’t mean that men aren’t allowed to play basketball anymore. It just means that corporate bosses need to be a lot of more sensitive about organizing after-work activities that are inclusive of everyone. If that means that you don’t play basketball with your office, but with an external community league, so be it. It won’t be the end of the world. Being an egalitarian leader means having to make some sacrifices.\nGood for both of them.\nWe women who golf learned a long time ago that it helps solidify relationships, make men more comfortable off the course, and allows boht players to witness outside the office what we should already know from inside the office – namely, how people behave when things go your way – and when they don’t. Is it with honesty, humility, humor, and strength? It’s a great litmus test for any relationship, professional and personal. Good for President Obama for opening up the game.\nWhat Obama organized is a text book example of a boys-only club.\nThe president is never “off duty,” particularly when interacting with his employees.\nEvery moment of the president’s day is scheduled. An opportunity to spend time with him is precious to anyone who wants to have an influence on public policy. That’s why some people spend tens – if not hundreds – of thousands of dollars to play a round with him",
        "baseline": ". This is Politics 101.\nEvery nay-saying commenter here acknowledged that these games help the president bond with his staff and other advisors. Bonding with your boss is important. Women deserve an equal opportunity to do this.\nIf you don’t think its a problem that, after 22 golf games and numerous basketball games, NO women – until now – were given an equal opportunity to get face time and bond with the president, you are both a sexist and an ignoramus.\nAnd don’t fool yourselves – if a president Hillary Clinton organized 22+ golf games and a dozen bridge games and didn’t invite any male staff, you male reporters and pundits and commenters would be shrieking with outrage. You’d be crying about man-hating and calling for her impeachment. Admit it.\nWe do NOT need a White House modeled on Mad Men. If that’s the change B. has in mind, he can stuff it."

Six great restaurants with their very own gardens follow. Call them “roof to table.” By Jessica Allen.\nAtop a 100-year-old building in the West Village grow lettuces, bicolor squash, fennel, dill, parsley, poblano peppers, Japanese eggplant, and tomatoes, among other things, using soil-less, solar-powered hydroponic technology. Bell, Book & Candle incorporates these and other vegetables and herbs into its New American food. Being so close to the source means the chefs don’t refrigerate the produce. In fact, they call the freshly grown produce “dormant, not dead,” since the roots are kept attached until the very last second before cooking.\nRoberta’s might look like a bunker from the outside, but inside the message is all about love—love of good food, love of food to create change, love of the community that comes together around good food. Behind its scruffy exterior lie terrific pizza and pasta, a radio station, a greenhouse, and a very big garden. You can see what’s growing via the garden’s blog, with its photos of violets, edible weeds, raspberries, basil, strawberries, watermelon, peaches, chard, and blackberries, or you can take a seat in the wooden-paneled dining room, beneath a pizza party Barbie and board games, and order whatever’s just been harvested.\nLike most Westin properties around the world, the newest one in New York City features luxurious amenities like the Heavenly Bed® (definitely worth its copyright in plushness), in-room Starbucks coffee, and special velour robes.

They could overheat, too.\nThe upshot could be that the gadget-crazy populace, accustomed to a retail drumbeat of breathtaking new products, may have to accept next-generation electronics that are only modestly better than their predecessors, rather than exponentially faster, cheaper and more wondrous.\nSimply put, the Next Big Thing may take longer to arrive.\nA paper presented in June at the International Symposium on Computer Architecture summed up the problem: even today, the most advanced microprocessor chips have so many transistors that it is impractical to supply power to all of them at the same time. So some of the transistors are left unpowered — or dark, in industry parlance — while the others are working. The phenomenon is known as dark silicon.\nAs early as next year, these advanced chips will need 21 percent of their transistors to go dark at any one time, according to the researchers who wrote the paper. And in just three more chip generations — a little more than a half-decade — the constraints will become even more severe. While there will be vastly more transistors on each chip, as many as half of them will have to be turned off to avoid overheating.\nThe problem has the potential to counteract an important principle in computing that has held true for decades: Moore’s Law. It was Gordon Moore, a founder of Intel, who first predicted that the number of transistors that could be nestled comfortably and inexpensively on an integrated circuit chip would double roughly every two years, bringing exponential improvements in consumer electronics.\nIf that rate of improvement lags, much of the innovation that people have come to take for granted will not happen, or will happen at a much slower pace. There will not be new PCs, new smartphones, new LCD TVs, new MP3 players or whatever might become the new gadget that creates an overnight multibillion-dollar industry and tens of thousands of jobs.\nIn their paper, Dr. Burger and fellow researchers simulated the electricity used by more than 150 popular microprocessors and estimated that by 2024 computing speed would increase only 7.9 times, on average. By contrast, if there were no limits on the capabilities of the transistors, the maximum potential speedup would be nearly 47 times, the researchers said.\nSome scientists disagree, if only because new ideas and designs have repeatedly come along to preserve the computer industry’s rapid pace of improvement. Dr. Dally of Nvidia, for instance, is sanguine about the future of chip design.\n“The good news is that the old designs are really inefficient, leaving lots of room for innovation,” he said.\nBut other experts, not connected with Dr. Burger’s research, acknowledged that he and the paper’s other authors — from the University of Texas, the University of Washington and the University of Wisconsin — had put their finger on a real problem.\nDr. Borkar cited a variety of new design ideas that he said would help ease the limits identified in the paper. Intel recently developed a way to vary the power consumed by different parts of a processor, making it possible to have both slower, lower-power transistors as well as faster-switching ones that consume more power.\nIncreasingly, today’s processor chips contain two or more cores, or central processing units, that make it possible to use multiple programs simultaneously. In the future, Intel computers will have different kinds of cores optimized for different kinds of problems, only some of which require high power.\nAnd while Intel announced in May that it had found a way to use 3-D design to crowd more transistors onto a single chip, that technology does not solve the energy problem described in the paper about dark",
        "baseline": " silicon. The authors of the paper said they had tried to account for some of the promised innovation, and they argued that the question was how far innovators could go in overcoming the power limits.\n“Where things fall between the two is a matter of opinion,” Dr. Burger said.\nChip designers have been struggling with power limits for some time. A decade ago it was widely assumed that it would be straightforward to increase chips’ clock speed, or the rate at which it makes calculations. Then the industry hit a wall at around three gigahertz, when the chips got so hot that they began to melt. That set off a frantic scramble for new designs.\nToday, some of the pioneering designers believe there is still plenty of room for innovation. One of them, David A. Patterson, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, called dark silicon a “real phenomenon” but said he was skeptical of the authors’ pessimistic conclusions."

This May, it just might be coming to a dealer near you.\nThe creator of the EMC3, ECO Motor Car Company, is a Seattle startup with a \"less is more\" philosophy. In this case, one less wheel is responsible for more fuel economy. No batteries, no pesky 25 mph speed restrictions. While the EMC3 looks like a miniature convertible, as far as the DOT is concerned it's a full-fledged two-seater motorcycle with all the necessary government approvals. Depending on options, it's expected to sell for between $13,995 and $14,995. The only thing it's missing is a rear wheel.\nJim Evans is the sales manager at Townline Auto Group of Danielson, CT, a launch dealer for the eye-catching trike. He's already driving a prototype, and so far he's pretty impressed. Driving is a \"great, fun experience,\" Evans told Wired.com. \"Handling is like your auto, not like a converted motorcycle or something like the T-Rex, Scorpion or any of the other reverse trikes.\"\nOh yeah, and did we mention it gets 60 mpg?\nThe formula for EMC3 is simple: Car - excess weight = higher fuel economy. With a curb weight between 1,300 and 1,500 lbs depending on transmission, it's not hard to see how ECO squeezes Prius-beating numbers out of their trike. Power comes from a 1.0 liter, 52 horsepower SOHC three-cylinder six-valve engine with an aluminum head and iron block, mated to either an automatic or manual transmission. As if owners won't be armed with enough conversation starters, consider that the EMC3 is built in China by Geely. That means it's the first ever Chinese car Chinese-built enclosed vehicle capable of highway speeds to be sold in the US.\nEvans is quick to note that the driving experience will be familiar and comfortable even for drivers who have never been on a bike. \"No more noise than a typical convertible, much less noise than a motorcycle,\" he told Wired.com. \"Our first deposit came from a gentleman, 6'6\" and 275 lbs – no problem with leg room or accessing the vehicle.\" The interior is serviceable and comfortable, and the dash looks",

The Aptera it is not. That doesn't mean it doesn't attract attention. Evans said that even though the gas tank is only ten gallons, it still takes him 20 minutes to fill up once he's finished answering questions about the car. In fact, Evans himself only got involved with ECO Motors after seeing it on television and finding it irresistible. Now, he's the sole distributor for the northeast and expects sales to take off. \"We definitely will be a destination dealer,\" he told Wired.com. With no paid advertising, Townline already has six deposits. The first non-prototype, production car trike, which will be white with an automatic transmission, should arrive in early May."

The meeting is the first public convening of the nation’s top civil rights leaders since a spate of police violence sparked unrest in cities across the nation, starting with the shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., last August.\nSharpton said that he plans personally to petition Senate Republicans to hold a floor vote on Lynch’s nomination. He also plans trips to three states where religious objections laws have either been passed or are being considered.\nOnce a skeptic of the gay rights movement, Sharpton has in recent years emerged as one of its most vocal black supporters. These days, he argues that gay rights should be considered a civil rights matter. He said bringing gay and lesbian groups into the civil rights fold is crucial to bolstering the political power of those working on civil justice issues.\nSuch issues — gay rights and reforms in policing, criminal justice and prisons — have dominated the national discussion in recent months, opening the door for civil rights groups to claim a higher profile during the presidential campaign, some civil rights leaders say.\nThis week’s conference will help advance that cause, they say, and help focus efforts to define the issues to be highlighted in 2016.\nCampbell is one of several leaders of civil rights organizations — including the heads of the NAACP and the Urban League — who plan to participate in a panel intended to chart a course, and to funnel energy from national protests in favor of policing and criminal justice reforms toward political action and achieving tangible results.\n“We need to be working collaboratively around how we apply elevated pressure on the candidates to talk about these issues,” Campbell said.\nShar",

        "prompt": "A La Carte TV Is Coming — But Will Consumers Be Better Off?\nThe great TV unbundling experiment is underway and it’s bound to rewrite the economics of the cable industry, as well as that of traditional media companies.\nOn October 15, Time Warner unveiled plans to launch a stand-alone HBO subscription separate from cable providers in 2015. A day later, CBS created an “all access” $5.99 a month subscription to its website and mobile apps featuring live streams of local stations, as well as full seasons of current shows, which will be available the day after they are aired, and an archive of classic content such as Star Trek and Cheers.\nBut where will individual subscription options, which are known as “over the top”plans, lead the industry —and consumers? Currently, the quintessential over the top subscription plan is Netflix’s streaming service. For a monthly fee, consumers access Netflix’s original content, such as Orange is the New Black and House of Cards, as well as an extensive library of licensed movie and television content. Netflix’s has focused its marketing and growth efforts on Internet streaming, though the company also offers DVDs or Blu-ray discs by mail.\nShortly after Richard Plepler, CEO of HBO, announced the channel’s Internet subscription effort, questions and speculation emerged about the economics of the plan. Plepler called the service “transformative,” but neglected to mention many details.\nThe Wall Street Journal later reported that HBO would price its service at no less than what it costs cable subscribers — roughly $15. The goal for HBO would be to keep so-called cord cutters—those with only a broadband connection and no cable TV—in the fold. HBO could also offer its Internet subscription with cable broadband partners as a package. FBR analyst Barton Crockett said in a research note that if HBO could convince four million people to pay $15 a month for the Internet-only service it could generate $500 million in incremental revenue a year.\nThe plan announced by CBS included more details, yet analysts questioned its appeal. CBS will charge $5.99 a month and subscriptions will be available on Internet connected devices. Geotargeting will enable news stations to keep streams local. The catch is that new CBS content, unlike that of HBO, not to mention over the air for consumers with a digital receiver or converter box, said Gabelli analyst Brett Harriss.\nAnalysts called the CBS service the network’s own version Hulu Plus and noted that the Internet subscription is more of an insurance policy in case viewers move away from cable bundles more quickly than expected.\nThe move to stand-alone subscription plans simply reflects the competitive dynamics of today’s TV landscape. CBS’ move or HBO’s could spur other broadcast and cable networks to offer their own subscription plans. If all media companies created their own subscriptions, the current system of bundling channels into a single cable subscription could be in trouble: Why would cable companies pay fees to networks when their content is no longer exclusive?\nNeedham analyst Laura Martin questioned CBS’ math. “We don’t get it. For every household that subscribes to the new CBS service outside the TV bundle for $6/month and turns off the TV bundle, CBS loses $1.50/month and the rest of the TV content companies lose $40/month,” said Martin. Those figures are her estimate of what cable companies pay content owners each month. The risk is that CBS destabilizes the bundle system and loses money, she added.\nBundles will likely continue to exist, explains Werbach.

A county sheriff's dispatcher told NBC News there were some reports of injuries, but it was too early to have any indication of their number or severity. Officials also reported two tornadoes touched down in northern Iowa.\nAt one point, tornado warnings — meaning a tornado had been confirmed or that conditions were such that one was imminent — were in effect simultaneously in Iowa, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana.\nEarly Thursday, a powerful supercell system was approaching metropolitan Cleveland, carrying baseball-size hail and significant potential for a tornado, said Nick Wiltgen, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel.\nIt was the leading edge of a storm system with almost 75 million people in its path at the beginning of what Mike Seidel, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel, said was going to be a \"long and ugly night\" for Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Indianapolis and the rest of the Midwest.\nAbout 71,000 customers were without power in parts of Indiana, Illinois and Ohio, utilities reported Wednesday night. Flash flooding was also risk throughout the region, the Weather Service warned.\nThe Weather Channel reported \"buildings destroyed\" in Auglaize County as powerful winds blew through Ohio's northern Miami Valley early Thursday, though no details were immediately available. In the same county, a semi truck was toppled by high winds, NBC station WDTN TV in Dayton reported.\nLater Thursday, the storm is projected to blast an enormous area of the East stretching from New York south to Atlanta with damaging wind gusts and heavy rain.\n\"This is a particularly dangerous situation,\" the National Weather Service said in an alert.\nAbout 75 million Americans are in the path of a severe storm system that could bring a derecho, a group of thunderstorms accompanied by severely damaging winds. Mike Seidel of The Weather Channel reports.\nA home in Lemont, a suburb of Chicago, burst into flames when it was struck by lightning and was still burning Wednesday night, NBC Chicago reported.\nIn Lake Delton, Wis., a \"very, very strong downpour of rain\" caused the roof over a loading dock to collapse at a Wal-Mart store late Wednesday afternoon, police said.\nPolice Sgt. William Hitchcock told NBC station WTMJ of Milwaukee that no serious injuries were reported, but the store is likely to be closed through Thursday.\nThe storm system, the product of hot air streaming up from the south and churning of the atmosphere over Minnesota, was certain to bring ugly weather.\nForecasters said it was trickier to predict whether it would produce the little-known phenomenon of a derecho, but \"conditions seem to be favorable for one this week,\" said Nick Wiltgen, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel. \"Maybe more than one.\"\nA derecho can cause damage similar to a tornado but moves along a straighter line. (In Spanish, the term can mean \"direct.\") To qualify, the swath of wind damage must be 240 miles long and include wind gusts of 58 mph or higher along most of its path.\nThis photo, also available from a NOAA storm summary, shows the leading edge of a derecho in LaPorte, Ind., on June 29, 2012.\nLast June, a derecho packing wind of close to 100 mph roared from Illinois to the Mid-Atlantic, killing 13 people, causing $1 billion in damage and leaving more than 4 million people without power.

        "prompt": "3 Does Not Eating Affect an Athlete's Performance?\n4 What Are Negative Results from Eating No Carbs?\nAlthough going low-carb or low-fat may help some people lose weight, combining the two diets can spell trouble for your health as well as your enjoyment of life. What's more, cutting food groups is no guarantee of weight loss. You shed fat by consuming fewer calories than your body burns for energy, no matter what types of fare you choose.\nOnly three macronutrient groups provide calories: fat, carbohydrates and protein. Cut out the fat and carbs, and you're left with just protein. Most Americans already consume more protein than they need, and a low-carb, low-fat diet can easily lead to dangerous protein intake. Your body uses extra water to process protein, so consuming too much may contribute to dehydration -- already a concern on a reduced-calorie diet. Excessive protein intake may also cause you to expel too much calcium in your urine, possibly weakening your bones, according to Jessica Matthews, professor of exercise science at Miramar College. This may eventually increase your risk of osteoporosis, a condition in which bones grow brittle and prone to fracture.\nBecause the primary options on a low-carb, low-fat plan are lean proteins, your diet may become too limited for optimal nutrition. You'll miss out on healthy whole grains, nuts, olive oil and many fruits and vegetables. These \"taboo\" foods are rich in nutrients that your body needs, such as fiber, heart-healthy unsaturated fats and an array of vitamins and minerals. A healthier idea is to simply cut out refined carbs such as white bread -- which are lower in nutrients than whole-wheat bread and other unrefined grains -- and curb cholesterol-spiking saturated fats from butter, fatty meats and full-fat dairy.\nThe key to weight-loss success is developing healthy habits, not depriving yourself. As the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics notes, any plan that you can't see yourself following for the rest of your life is not the right diet for you. Eating little besides lean meat, fish, egg whites and select vegetables is not sustainable for most people, and you'll likely become bored or frustrated before long. Even",

Brown and her three sisters spent a lot of time playing on the beach and in the ocean.\nThey were popular girls, and their home was the place that friends congregated before heading home in time for their curfew - just before the street lights came on.\nBy the time Ms. Brown graduated high school and was heading to college, six of her friends had died, mostly related to drinking and driving.\n“There was no (drug) addiction like we see today. Back then, drinking and driving was a big problem,” Ms. Brown said in a telephone interview last week. She is the baby sister of Nicole Brown Simpson, O.J. Simpson’s ex-wife, who was murdered in 1994.\nMs. Brown, an author and life coach, will be the keynote speaker at the SHINE Initiative’s 12th annual Keep Your Mind Open gala at Mechanics Hall on Thursday.\nHer sister, who was 10 years older, was murdered along with a friend, Ronald Goldman. She said the murder, which remains unsolved, turned the family’s lives upside down. But she continued to hold in the grief, though her parents were both very supportive. They taught their children to move on with life. Grief counselors for young people, she said, wasn’t something that was popular then.\nFinally, in 2004, when her fiancé canceled their wedding four days before the event, her emotional and mental health was on overload, leading to a mental breakdown.\n“It was another loss, and I went into full self-destruct mode. I was popping pills, drinking and eating everything, and I ballooned up to 200 pounds,” she recalled.\nDuring one of her emotional episodes at the family home, she blamed her parents for everything that had happened to her, as well as for Nicole’s murder. She left the room and prepared to end her life by downing 24 Klonopin pills with a glass of wine.\nOne of her sisters intervened, and her family had her admitted to a psychiatric unit at a local hospital for two weeks. There, she was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, also referred to as clinical depression. She spent another few weeks in outpatient therapy. Ms. Brown said that led her to get a graduate degree in psychology and become an advocate for education about domestic violence and mental wellness. She is the author of \"Finding Peace Amid the Chaos: My Escape From Depression and Suicide.\"\nThe first week of October each year is Mental Health Awareness Week. Also called Mental Illness Awareness Week, it was established by Congress in 1990.\nApproximately 60 million Americans will likely experience a mental disorder in their lifetime, but more than half of people living with diagnosable mental health disorders do not seek treatment, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.\nThe SHINE Initiative was founded by Fidelity Bank in 2004 with input from its employees to reduce the stigma of mental health conditions, end discrimination and raise awareness and understanding about mental health conditions in children, adolescents and young adults.\nThe annual gala celebrates the accomplishments of the nonprofit while raising funds to support the expansion of programs, including Student Wellness Advisory Teams that empower middle and high school students to become mental wellness advocates in their schools. The student-led teams began in 2015, and now number about 17; that is expected to increase to 40 within the next year.\nMs. Brown is among several high-profile mental health advocates who have spoken at the annual SHINE galas. Last year’s keynote speaker was Margaret Trudeau, the mother of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who discussed her experiences with bipolar disorder, including how the stigma of mental illness helped to delay her diagnosis and treatment.\nThis year’s event also celebrates the work of Paul Richard of Worcester, the outgoing executive director of the SHINE Initiative. Also, Fred Kaelin of West Boylston will be introduced as the new executive director; he began work in September and will begin his leadership Nov. 1.\nMr. Richard, 66, was director of development for Community Healthlink for more than a decade before he became executive director of the SHINE Initiative. He said the nonprofit has impacted tens of thousands of young people and adults.\n“What makes me the most proud is the direct engagement with young people throughout Central Massachusetts … their willingness and desire to talk about mental health and mental wellness in a positive uplifting way,” he said. After retirement, he said, he plans to stay involved in some form of human services.\nMr. Kaelin, 44, married father of two young boys, said his main goal is to continue the work that Mr. Richard has done to build the agency and to get into more schools throughout Central Massachusetts and Middlesex County",

The new website should be up and running in a few months, Mr. Kaelin said.\n“The more awareness that gets out there about mental health and the more people who get support earlier in life means a community will be healthier, not just the individual who gets the individual support,” he said.\nTickets to the gala, which begins at 5 p.m. Thursday at Mechanics Hall, cost $100.

So we take the power back and we acknowledge ourselves and each other,” Tessa Thompson told BuzzFeed News.\nFrom left: Honorees Tessa Thompson, Lena Waithe, Tiffany Haddish, and Danai Gurira onstage during the 2018 Essence Black Women in Hollywood Oscars Luncheon in Beverly Hills.\nIf you, like Issa Rae, were rooting for everyone black this awards season, you only got to celebrate a few moments. At Sunday’s 90th Academy Awards, there was Jordan Peele’s Best Original Screenplay win for Get Out and Kobe Bryant’s Best Short Film (Animated) win for Dear Basketball. (And even that win for Bryant had a problematic shadow cast over it due to the former NBA player’s past.) Earlier this year at the Golden Globes, Sterling K. Brown won for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series. And at the Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards, Oprah Winfrey and Morgan Freeman were given honorary awards respectively. But that’s about it.\nAt the Oscars, some of the nominees included Denzel Washington and Daniel Kaluuya for Best Actor, and Octavia Spencer and Mary J. Blige, both for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Granted, this was an especially unpredictable year but none of the aforementioned actors prevailed with a golden statue. While Peele made history for winning Best Original Screenplay, he did not win in the coveted Best Director category in which only four black men have been nominated in 90 years — none of whom have won. Mudbound director Dee Rees joined the list of black female directors who didn’t even get nominated in the category despite having her film recognized for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Supporting Actress (Blige). Tiffany Haddish was overlooked altogether for her hilarious comedic performance in Girls Trip, unlike Melissa McCarthy for her role in Bridesmaids, widely categorized as Girls Trip’s white-counterpart film. And finally, one of 2017’s most successful films, Get Out, failed to win for Best Picture — and this time the envelope was read correctly.\nBut #OscarsSoWhite isn’t anything new, and Black Hollywood no longer waits for their recognition at mainstream award shows. In fact, almost everyone who deserved to be honored for their work this year was celebrated in the week leading up to the Oscars — it just didn’t happen at ceremonies that air live on network television. Instead, it happened in “rooms of requirement” created for us, by us: At annual pre-Oscar awards ceremonies like the American Black Film Festival Honors (ABFF) and Essence’s Black Women in Hollywood Luncheon; intimate dinners like Common’s Toast to the Arts and Alfre Woodard’s Sistahs Soiree; and black excellence parties like the one Jay-Z and Beyoncé threw this year that shook up the post-Oscar party scene that used to have a clear hierarchy. Each of these events look like a powerful sea of melanin, and leave a current so strong every glimpse can’t help but go viral.\nLeft: Dave Chappelle, Jordan Peele, Jay-Z, Kobe Bryant, and Anthony Anderson. Right: Tiffany Haddish, Danai Gurira, Marcus Henderson, Jay-Z, Winston Duke, and Lupita Nyong'o at Jay-Z and Beyoncé's Oscars afterparty.\nThompson was honored at the magazine’s 11th annual luncheon, created to honor black women both in front of and behind the camera in Hollywood. The ceremony, which airs on Oprah Winfrey’s OWN network (notice a trend?), also honored Black Panther’s Danai Gurira, Girls Trip’s Haddish, and Master of None star and creator of The Chi, Lena Waithe, this year. Held at the Beverly Wilshire hotel in Los Angeles, the event can best be described as a huge black girl magic brunch where all of your Black Hollywood faves (and I do mean all) come together to uplift, celebrate, and fellowship with one another. Many of the women in attendance that day echoed Thompson’s feelings and noted that the luncheon is their favorite awards season event, even more than the Academy Awards itself.\nClockwise from left: Susan Kelechi Watson, Yvette Nicole Brown, Lupita Nyong'o, Honoree Lena Waithe, Honoree Tessa Thompson, Sonequa Martin-Green, Edwina Findley Dickerson, and Honoree Danai Gurira attend the 2018 Essence Black Women in Hollywood Oscars Luncheon in Beverly Hills.\nThat subtle change in how Waithe framed her speech demonstrates the difference between these events and the traditional awards season ceremonies. There’s a level of comfort present in the former, a common bond formed through the struggle of being black in Hollywood, and in the case of Essence’s luncheon specifically, a sisterhood that’s formed when a win for one is a win for all.\nHonoree Danai Gurira (left) and Lupita Nyong'o onstage during the 2018 Essence Black Women in Hollywood Oscars Luncheon.\n“It’s important for us to remember who we are, and when we look into the eyes of those like us, we remember who we are, we get renewed, we get inspired, we get rejuvenated, we get revived,” Gurira told BuzzFeed News. The Black Panther star went on to explain how many of the women in attendance have broken down barriers and opened doors for future generations of black women in Hollywood to move through. Gurira herself was in the room five years ago watching Oprah Winfrey, Alfre Woodard, Gabrielle Union, Mara Brock-Akil, Naomie Harris, and Quvenzhané Wallis be honored. Since then her star has risen with a hit show (The Walking Dead), No. 1 movie (Black Panther), and a play under her belt (Eclipse). So as she stood onstage accepting her award, presented by another former honoree, Lupita Nyong’o, the newer actors in the room saw that upward mobility in Hollywood is possible for black actors, and that they are not alone in the obstacles they face while trying to achieve it.\nLil Rel Howery (left) and Daniel Kaluuya during the 2018 Essence Black Women in Hollywood Oscars Luncheon.\nThe ABFF Honors were held exactly one week before the Oscars, honoring Ava DuVernay, Omari Hardwick, Tiffany Haddish, Billy Dee Williams, and the cast of Martin while also awarding Black-ish, Insecure, Get Out, and Queen Sugar in various traditional categories. It was the only event during awards season where you could see Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell-Martin mend their rift onstage, or Issa Rae joke about being too drunk to give a proper acceptance speech, or hear about how Omari Hardwick paid for the craft services while they filmed Middle of Nowhere together because DuVernay couldn’t afford it.\nClockwise from left: American Black Film Festival Founder & CEO Jeff Friday, Nicole Friday, Omari Hardwick, Tiffany Haddish, and Billy Dee Williams at the 2018 American Black Film Festival Honors Awards in Beverly Hills, California.\nCommon took his support a step further by creating his own platform to do so, through his Toast to the Arts dinner held in West Hollywood the Friday before the Oscars.

And they give black actors a place to convene and be in the room since many are often not even invited to awards season’s darling ceremonies, as Gabrielle Union pointed out at the Golden Globes in January when she revealed that was the first time she received an invitation to attend. And when you’re constantly snubbed a seat at the table, it’s only a matter of time before you create your own damn table. That’s what these events are: a space for black artists to be fed both literally and figuratively before they’ve even stepped foot on red carpets; to know that their work mattered whether or not it was recognized by the Academy, the Hollywood Foreign Press, or the rest of the Screen Actors Guild."

        "prompt": "The Witness is an argument. It uses game design, audio, and video to present its case about our relation to the search for truth.\nDeveloper Thekla and designer Jonathan Blow’s puzzle game is a challenging adventure where you draw lines, listen to orations, and watch YouTube clips. It sounds simple, but as you go through that journey, The Witness uses these elements to make claims about the human experience while also providing evidence for those claims.\nPut simply, The Witness is about exploration and the human need to reach out and understand the unknown.\nYou have the capability to seek the truth.\nIt’s noble to seek the truth.\nInterpreting the truth through common experience is important to understanding it.\nYou’ll never reach the truth.\nThe Witness claims that the search for truth is the story of humanity. Individually, we witness existence moment to moment, and then we collectively combine those experiences over eons to empower the next generation of explorers to witness something new as a representative of our species.\nThat’s a big case to make, and it all starts with you playing a game.\nPlaying The Witness in the context of its wider argument is about the importance of games throughout history to both people and animals.\nIn The Witness, you encounter confusing puzzles with esoteric rules. When you first try to solve these, they can appear daunting to the point of impossibility. Or you might assume that you’re not smart enough to figure these things out. But over time, you slowly begin building up a mental vocabulary that enables you to decode and conquer these mazes until you reach a level of fluency with the game’s world.\nIn this way, The Witness is no different from the games of other species. A lion cub plays with its siblings to help it get comfortable with moving and leaping. This is preparation for a life of hunting and fighting off competitors. Studies have also shown that rats (and some primates) play games to fine-tune their fight-or-flight responses.\nThe Witness is a way to help you fine-tune your fight-or-flight response in the face of challenging cerebral problems. If you battle through Blow’s puzzles, you may end up feeling more capable of taking the more complex ideas of the real world.\nAnd having confidence in your capability to understand and solve problems is something The Witness reiterates in one of the first videos you play in the theater room hidden beneath the windmill.\nThe video is from the 1978 BBC science program Connections. It is from the final episode of the original series. Presenter James Burke sums up the core argument of his show, which is that understanding how the world works is how you have a say in its future.\nBurke claims that the scientists and technologists who understand the fundamentals of nature are the “true driving force of humanity.” And he maintains that you can have that power, too. You don’t have to wait for someone to come around and give it to you. Instead, you have the capability to start asking questions and making discoveries for yourself.\nAnd the fact that you’ve beaten The Witness is proof of your capabilities.\nIt doesn’t matter if you asked for help while playing the game. It isn’t a failing that you needed to ask someone to explain something to you slowly and clearly. All that matters is that you understood it in the end, and you were able to act on that understanding. You’re intelligent and capable and all of human knowledge belongs to you.\nBurke goes a bit further and says that you don’t need to settle for second- or third-hand interpretations of the truth. To illustrate his point, he compares a slide of amino acids to a classical painting. He says that the amino acids are more difficult for people to understand than art and poetry because scientific knowledge removes opinion and ideology.\nThat might seem dismissive of the humanities, but Burke never says that art doesn’t matter. He only says that it isn’t truth — instead, it’s an interpretation of the truth by someone else.\nRegardless of Burke’s feelings on softer pursuits, I don’t think The Witness is in any way criticizing the study of why people express themselves through art and culture. You can try to claim that Burke is saying that, but then you are only arguing against an old British television host and not The Witness.\nThe more important part of what Burke is saying is that you should have confidence in yourself to affect change. This is putting to words the experience of playing The Witness, and it is meant to link that to your experience of interacting with the rest of the world.\nThe Witness doesn’t just tell you that you have the ability to search for answers. It also repeatedly conveys that as something important and worth celebrating.\nYou get most of that motivation through the audio logs scattered throughout the world. These are excerpts of writings from famous people like Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu, English astronomer Arthur Eddington, and theologian Augustine of Hippo. In all, The Witness has quotes from around 40 people, and while they have different motivations (science, god, philosophy), they all have one thing in common: they are searchers. Even Nicholas of Cusa, a Catholic scholar, speaks eloquently on his uncertainty and the importance of the hunt for truth.\nIf The Witness kicks off its conversation with Burke telling you that you are smart enough to look for answers, the audio logs are telling you that you should use that intelligence.\nBut the game doesn’t just shove a bunch of quotes at you to say “here’s smart people — you should be like them.” It argues that these pursuits are important because you are part of something bigger.\nThe candle scene, which is the third video in the screening room in The Witness, is from the 1983 Russo-Italian coproduction Nostalghia by director Andrei Tarkovsky. It is about a Russian poet longing for home while researching a composer in Italy. This particular scene is Tarkovsky’s attempt to portray an entire human life in one shot.\nIt is nine minutes of uninterrupted filming where Andrei Gorchakov, the protagonist, lights a candle, carries it across an empty pool, and sets it on a ledge before dying.\nThis scene conveys how life carries on from one person to the next. In Nostalghia, Andrei meets a mad man who hates the world but believes he can cure it if he can only carry a lit candle across his town’s mineral pool. The mad man never succeeds and eventually kills himself after leaving town and giving a speech asking people to grow kinder. But before he does that, he asks Andrei to complete his candle mission. Luckily for the poet, he finds that the town has drained the mineral pool.\nIn terms of The Witness, we’re seeing a scene where someone is trying to complete a seemingly meaningless task. He’s doing this because he believes it’s important, and he only thinks that because his dead friend convinced him it is worth seeing through.\nIt’s about one life building on top of another to accomplish a common goal. In that way, multiple generations of humans — all destined to have their flames flicker and go out — can have the spirit of their ideas outlive them.\nThe Witness reflects that by having you build ideas one on top of another until you’re equipped to defeat its challenges.\nThekla’s artists reference this idea using statues. The most notable example of this is one woman reaching down to pull up another (as long as you are looking from the right spot on the map).\nAbove: If you are standing in the Marsh, you can look toward the mountain and see this.\nThis visual trick has a woman up on a perch pulling another out of the ground. This is an important visual metaphor where the mountain represents the huddling mass of life. This is why the peak has statues of exhausted designers and craftsmen building their masterpieces on the summit of human accomplishments. It is also why the mountain leads to the finale.\nThe mountain reaches into the sky like humanity, but only if we reach higher if we look back and pull up the ideas that we identify as valuable and worth saving. At the top of the mountain we see the opposite happening where a woman is shouting at a man clutching a book. She is backing him off a cliff. This is because his ideas are something we don’t want any more, and he doesn’t get to stand on the summit with us any longer.\nAll this pushing and pulling happens because humanity and all life is a single entity, and an audio log on the mountain’s peak explains that clearly.\nThe excerpt is from Apollo astronaut Russell “Rusty” Schweickart. In it, he talks about how space travel changed him.\nDuring his time with NASA, Schweickart has landed on the moon and performed extravehicular activities (EVAs) while orbiting the Earth. He’s seen our planet as a tiny blue marble surrounded in every direction by cold blackness. From where he stood, he could cover this world with his thumb. And all of that gave him a perspective about life and his place in it.\nThe astronaut explains that he keeps using the word “you” because it was all of us that did that. It wasn’t him. It was we.\nSchweickart is essentially saying that he was merely a witness on behalf of the rest of us. He was the eye of the single organism called life. And all of us make up the various parts of life’s body. And we all contributed in the journey that took the first single-celled organisms out of the muck and onto the surface of another world.\nWe did that. And your flickering, burning spirit is contributing to it.\nBut life doesn’t only advance through scientific knowledge, like Burke suggested in his video. And The Witness brings in theoretical physicist and Nobel prize winner Richard Feynman to make that point.\nIn 1964, Feynman, who worked on the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb and investigated the Challenger shuttle disaster, gave a talk at Cornell University about the interconnecting hierarchies of life.\nThese hierarchies represent the ways we talk about the world. On the one end is scientific knowledge and fundamental principles. To the extreme side of the spectrum, you wouldn’t use words like “heat.” You’d say that “particles are jiggling in a rapid way and producing excess energy.” Because heat is a higher concept and not a way of describing what is happening at the most basic level.\nThe spectrum whips from those fundamental laws to abstract ideas like “hope” and “love” that have very little direct connection to the building blocks of reality. While one side is based on empirical data and the other is based on human experience and interpretation, Feynman says that we need both and everything in between to reach a more “ultimate” truth.\nThe Witness embraces this holistic approach. Making a game is about combining poetry and math, the humanities and the hard sciences, into an experience by humans for humans. You don’t do that if you think all that matters is scientific truth.\nThe Witness is not The Da Vinci Code.\nOne of the most difficult videos to unlock is The Secret of Psalm 46. You can only find it by completing the final, random challenge room hidden inside the mountain. The clip is an hour-long talk from renowned Infocom and LucasArts designer Brian Moriarty from Game Developers Conference 2003, and it is about Easter eggs and digging for hidden secrets.\nMoriarty details a history of Easter eggs in works of literature and classical paintings that goes back hundreds of years. He points out that humans are often wired to look for hidden things where they may not exist. This leads to quasi-numerologists “finding” hidden truths in the Bible, in the music of J.S. Bach, and in the works of William Shakespeare. Of course, no one can ever corroborate those discoveries.\nPeople go on quests looking for codecs that will help them understand the “real” meaning of Shakespeare like they are heroes in the Dan Brown novel The Da Vinci Code. That’s a story where Leonardo da Vinci hides secrets about the Illuminati and the secrets of Jesus Christ in this paintings for future generations to uncover.\nMoriarity points out that da Vinci, Bach, and Shakespeare are not crucial to Western civilization because they are burying messages in their creations for anyone with the right decoder. These people are important because they shaped the human understanding of art, music, and language.\nGreat games should do the same, which is why we probably won’t find out in 20 years that someone unlocked some new message inside of The Witness.\nMore important, this is a message that sometimes the search for truth can go wrong. It can lead you into bottomless pits that have no purpose.\nThis most often happens when you start with a belief or idea — like Shakespeare is really Sir Francis Bacon — and begin searching for patterns in the evidence to support that notion. The Witness doubles down on the perils of beginning a search with an answer or even a question in mind in a second clip from Feynman.\nIn 1981, the physicist gave an interview with BBC where he talked about why it’s important for people investigating the world to never predetermine what it is they’re trying to do. This leads him to criticize the “special stories” of religions, which are nearly always guilty or providing certain, single solutions for subjects that are impossible to prove.\nAs a counter to that way of approaching the world, Feynman suggests that you should assume that “everything is possibly wrong.” It’s easier to accept new experiences and new evidence if you are purely seeking instead of trying to match the world to your preconceived ideas.\nThe Witness has a story. You might not believe that because it is easy to miss, but a narrative pops up in a handful of the audio logs.\nIn these clips we get to hear conversations between the voice cast: Ashley Johnson. Phil LaMarr. Matthew Waterson. Terra Deva. But they are not quoting anyone famous. Instead, they are playing the people who curated the audio for this island that actually exists in the reality of The Witness.\nWe hear them talk about visiting the island. They reference how it changed them and how it puts them in a “very susceptible state.” They also discuss lucid dreaming and memory suppression along with some sort of test.\nThanks to this Reddit post for helping me find these clips.\nThe plot is loose and leaves lots of room for you to fill in the gaps. It starts with LaMarr and Waterson arguing about whether or not to include some raw conversations. It then includes an example of that where Waterson embarrasses himself by asking Johnson if she wants a sandwich. Another audio log has the team discussing the difficulty of including atheists. And it ends with the actors talking about visiting the island and how it has changed them and has them thinking about things differently.\nBut the story and who these people are isn’t nearly as fascinating as what they say about their work. The most important thing here is the discussion about authenticity.\nLaMarr is trying to convince Waterson about the benefits of including authentic conversations, and the reason he wants this is another important point about the game and about every clever person The Witness holds up as an example of intelligence.\nThis is The Witness shouting in your face that it is not presenting any answers because everything in the game is about truth-seeking and contemplation. Even the most religious pieces of audio, from someone like Nicholas of Cusa, dwell on how humans know nothing and should always keep looking.\nAnd many of us need to hear the game say that because otherwise we’d assume that the final solution to all these ideas is still buried somewhere within.\nAs a bonus, LaMarr’s point that this is “an endeavor built by human beings” and a clip where Johnson wants to try the Cusa quote for herself after visiting the island tie the plot into the central theme of The Witness. This a team of people working together to find the truth of their performance. They are also always learning from one another and building new skills, and this enables them to build something better.\nFinally, the last major point of The Witness is that you should stop seeking the truth. I know this sounds like it is counter to everything that has come before, but it comes with a caveat: Stop seeking the truth if what you are looking for is peace, love, and happiness.\nThe fifth and six videos from the theater room touch heavily on this. The first of these is a man on a stool who talks about nonduality. This is Rupert Spira, a British potter and philosopher. His ideas of nonduality (which Hal Holbrook touches on in an the sixth season of The Sopranos) is that you are already complete. You are an entity that experiences consciousness and knowing, and that is enough to make you feel at peace. And your searching only comes in to serve the separate self that exists in a body that you perceive as having sensations and compulsions that need quenching.\nThis is an abstract way of saying you are already happy, and you don’t need external input for love.\nThe Witness builds on this idea in the second of these two videos, which features spiritual leader Gangaji talking about how to achieve peace.\nShe says that you can find out who you are by ending your chase for a career, romance, truth. Instead, let calmness and silence overtake you, and that will reveal to you that you have everything that makes you complete.\nAt this point, The Witness is discussing subjects that are well removed from the act of playing The Witness.\nIt’s possible that Blow is suggesting that you are discovering silence in the moments when your mind creates the solution to a puzzle in your head. Or when you step away from the game, and come back to find that you immediately have the answer to something that was stumping you for hours.\nBut it’s also possible that we are on the other end of a journey. We started with Burke telling us that we should ask questions and believe in our ability to get the answers. But he never said that would make us happy. And Spira and Gangaji are here to remind us that an outward search isn’t the key to feeling peace and love — to find those resources, you’ll need to stop and remember what is within.\nI think it might be easy to take the message of Spira and Gangaji as an antithesis that undoes the rest of The Witness. Both of them suggest that you stop looking in order to feel love and peace. But love, peace, and happiness are not the only things that fulfill us as human beings. If they are, and Blow knows this, why even make a game?\nWell, you make a game because you want to inspire people with awe.\nThroughout the game people like Einstein, Feynman, and Nicholas of Cusa have repeatedly revealed why we look for truth even if it won’t make us happy. But developer Moriarty puts it best in his Psalm 46 video when he tells us that we dig into things like Shakespeare and Bach because their creativity is a revelatory experience that fills us with awe.\nAnd this search is what drives us to the edge and convinces us that we need to go even further — even if that is sometimes dangerous and cruel.\nIt was awe that pushed Schweickart into space. It was our species’s collective desire for something awesome that led to the atomic bomb. It was our need to describe the awe-inspiring experience of human life that led to the West adopting Shakespeare as its spokesperson.\nAnd as pretentious as it sounds, I think that Blow was going for that with The Witness. You’ll have to decide for yourself if it approaches that, but I think it’s worth applauding the ambition.\nNone of this means The Witness is above criticism. But I think it’s worth figuring out what something means so that I can figure out what is wrong with it. I do this to myself. I’ll do it with this game.\nBut I do think that playing this and breaking everything down has changed me. It helped me realize that I don’t need to immediately attack every idea before I let myself fully embrace it and understand it. I shouldn’",
        "baseline": "t deflect everything. Instead, I can let all new notions in, and then — once they are a part of me — I can lop off what doesn’t work.\nThat’s exactly what the process of figuring out puzzles in The Witness is like. You let every idea occur to you and you shave away what doesn’t work until you are left with a solution.\nOutside of games, we don’t have absolute “solutions” — but we can still use these skills to grow, to learn more, and to search farther. Just like we use the absolute rules of games like football and soccer to help us figure out an indefinite world.\nAnd I don’t know if that revelation is something that fills me with awe, but I do know that I like it.\nOh, and I fully understand it if all this seems like horseshit to you because you are too busy paying bills and having fun with friends."

        "prompt": "Warning: This post is a group effort by a few Multichannel News editors who watch Sci Fi Channel’s Battlestar Galactica. The opinions expressed are solely those of the editors; standard spoiler warnings and disclaimers apply.\nMidway through the final season of Battlestar, the ever-present tease to reveal the final Cylon was kicked into overdrive during the preview to this week’s episode.\nThe story so far: We’ve been told since the beginning that there are 12 Cylon models. We’ve known seven models for quite some time. Last season’s stunning finale unveiled that four of the final five were members of the Galactica crew: Saul Tigh, Galen Tyrol, Samuel T. Anders and Tory Foster.\nThat left fans of the show guessing at who the final Cylon could be – including our own Maria Hernandez, Eric Smith and Tom Umstead, plus me.\nTom thinks it has to be someone really big. Like Lee “Apollo” Adama. Actually Admiral William Adama, played by Edward J. Olmos, would be even cooler. But Eric and Maria point out a flaw in that theory. The “Last Supper” photo Sci Fi has used to promote the show this season includes both Adamas, and executive producer Ron Moore said in an interview the final Cylon is not depicted in that image.\nThe empty cup is supposed to represent the last Cylon. You can see the photo (and watch a 10-minute promo of tonight’s episode) here.\nEric has a new theory. The four revealed at the end of season three — Tigh, Tyrol, Tory and Samuel T. Anders — all had a \"T\" in their names. That could set up Kara Thrace or Tom Zarek as the final Cylon. But Eric thinks that’s actually a weak theory.\nEric and Maria were kicking around some ideas in an earlier email thread. I will set this up by saying the promo video implies D’Anna is telling Laura Roslin, the ailing colonial president played by Mary McDonnell, that she (Roslin) is a Cylon.\nEric: Roslin doesn’t look like she’s reacting to D’Anna. She reacts to something, but I think she would look much more horrified if she was just told she was a Cylon.\nMaria: I thought it was (Felix) Gaeta too, but after seeing how manipulative (Romo) Lampkin was, he’s got another vote. Can I get two votes?\nEric: It’s not Romo. Besides, he’s not on the base ship.\nMaria: Neither is Tyrol or Tigh.\nEric: Well, if we believe D’Anna is going to out the final Cylon tonight, that person would have to be on the base ship.\nMy personal feeling is that it’s Gaeta but I’m intrigued by the idea it’s Cottle. We know that it’s a skin job. Hypothetically, it could be several different characters who have already been killed before the story even began. Hence, the empty place at the \"table\" of the story of BSG characters.\nHowever, if we take them at their word that the final cylon is not in the picture, only consider \"live\" characters, believe it is someone of significance, and somewhat known, the choices are narrowed to Felix Gaeta, Dee Dualla, Doc Cottle and Romo Lampkin. I believe it should be someone who has been there since the beginning, which excludes Lampkin. Dee is just too boring. Gaeta and Cottle have both been flying somewhat under the cylon-suspicion radar. Someone I know also pointed out that Cottle is missing from the cast on scifi.com… just like he might be missing from the picture.\nUPDATE (includes spoiler): Well, no new Cylon was",

I’m glad I threw the remote at the couch instead of the TV. Once again the BSG team has taken us to the brink and left us hanging.\nMy money is still on Gaeta. Over the past four seasons, he has quietly become a pretty important cast member. The four of the final five that we already know were big players in the resistance on New Caprica, and Gaeta also played a very big role in the anti-Cylon efforts.\nOf course, I don’t know why he didn’t hear the funky version of \"All Along the Watchtower\" in the season three finale…which leads into a crackpot theory I had after that episode: Maybe the final Cylon is already on Earth. Maybe it’s Bob Dylan."

        "prompt": "Tavern on the Green, the iconic New York restaurant better known for its sales volume than stellar cuisine, will open a huge establishment at San Francisco's Metreon, the first step in a long-discussed repositioning of the troubled shopping center.\nThe 40,000-square-foot restaurant, about four times larger than Pat Kuleto's new Epic Roasthouse, will be located on the top floor, with an outdoor terrace overlooking Yerba Buena Gardens. The business will focus heavily on private events, catering to groups through nearby hotels and Moscone convention center. It will share the opulent (some say over-the-top) feel of the original Tavern on the Green, with chandeliers, murals and art, and may include a bar space serving lighter fare during the afternoon.\n\"We're very excited about moving to another area and spreading what we have here,\" said Jennifer LeRoy, chief executive officer of Tavern on the Green and daughter of the man who made the restaurant famous. \"We've gotten a lot of (expansion) opportunities, but it just seemed like the right time, right space and great partners.\"\nThose would include developers Westfield Group and Forest City Enterprises, which together bought the Metreon from a joint venture between Sony Corp. of America and Millennium Partners in 2006, saying at the time that it would be \"repositioned and re-tenanted.\"\nWestfield declined to elaborate then and didn't add much on Tuesday.\n\"Westfield and Forest City acquired Metreon with an eye towards revitalizing it to add to the dynamic nature of the Yerba Buena neighborhood,\" Westfield spokeswoman Catharine Dickey said in a statement. \"Tavern on the Green is an iconic name with local, regional and international appeal that is the first of several exciting new concepts and ideas under consideration.\"\nIndustry sources say that the owners, which also own the nearby Westfield San Francisco Centre, have been interviewing architects to reconfigure the Metreon space.\nThe problem is that the funky layout and tenant mix, originally trumpeted as a newfangled fusion of entertainment and retail, simply didn't work well for shops or shoppers. A stream of exhibits, stores and restaurants have come and gone since its opening in 1999, including the Way Things Work, Where the Wild Things Are, Microsoft, Discovery Channel and Montage. The most successful part of the shopping center is the 15-screen Loews Theatres.\nThe orientation \"fed the belly of the project and the food court and the theaters, but it really made the retail an afterthought,\" said Matt Holmes, principal with San Francisco brokerage firm Retail West.\nNew tenants like Tavern on the Green and planned design changes, which include moving the entrance and adding signs and glass storefronts to advertise the shops, should draw more traffic, he said.\nTavern on the Green has a storied history. Originally a Central Park sheepfold, it was converted to a restaurant in 1934. Warner LeRoy, the famed New York restaurateur who founded Maxwell's Plum Bar and later the Russian Tea Room, oversaw a $10 million renovation and reopened the restaurant in 1976.\nA rare example of fine dining on a massive scale, the more than 25,000-square-foot restaurant became a popular spot for Broadway openings, charity auctions and movie premieres.\nIt's made guest appearances in a handful of films, including \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Wall Street.\" To this day, it remains one of the largest-grossing independently owned restaurants in the country, with nearly $40 million in annual revenue and 600,000 visitors.\nIn 1995, then-New York Times restaurant critic Ruth Reichl famously deflated Tavern on the Green in a review that, while complimentary of the food, thrashed the service, citing long delays and an aloof waitstaff.\n\"To thousands of visitors, Tavern on the Green is New York,\" she wrote. \"Does it really have to be such a blatant example of our famous rudeness?\"\nReichl gave the",

He will oversee the San Francisco kitchen.\nThe restaurant is expected to open during summer 2009. The menu will be contemporary American, featuring local ingredients and wine selections.\n\"We understand we need to step up certain things,\" Desiderio said. \"We're expecting to get into this market and show how serious we are about food and service.\""

        "prompt": "Starring Sissy Spacek, Sam Shepard and Kyle Chandler the series arrives amid heightened competition in streaming TV, with Amazon, Yahoo and others making little secret of their determination to win market share from Netflix and HBO, the network behind Game of Thrones, planning a web-only service this year.\nAnd, while there's no lack of hype around Bloodline, it is perhaps fair to say it does not offer the instant allure of House of Cards or Orange Is The New Black.\nBoth those Netflix hits came with an easily digestible premise – Kevin Spacey is an evil politician, suburban woman goes to jail, embarks on voyage of self-discovery (with bonus girl-on-girl snogging).\nBloodline, in contrast, is rather murkier – a compelling show, without question, but requiring more upfront investment from the viewer.\nWith that in mind here is a countdown of essential Bloodline facts to get you started.\n1: It Has A Cast To Die For.\nSissy Spacek and Sam Shepard as old money proprietors of a Florida hotel sounds like the set-up for an Oscar-garlanded seventies movie you have yet to get around to seeing. It is a testament to Netflix's rising cachet that it is able to attract performers of such calibre.\n2: It's From The People Who Brought You Damages.\nIn addition to resurrecting the career of Glenn Close, Showtime's Damages was a fascinating experiment in just how much nasty 'mainstream' TV could pack into each episode – with darkly fascinating results. This was compelling television that made you crave a cold shower.\n3: Netflix Has HIGH Hopes For It.\nWhile House of Cards and, to an arguably lesser extent, Orange Is The New Black, have commandeered the zeitgeist, not every Netflix property is a guaranteed smash. Who, for instance, would miss perpetually misfiring Steve Van Zandt vehicle Lilyhammer? (Answer: Steve Van Zandt). But in Bloodline Netflix clearly believes it has another straight-up hit. It has sent its cast out to bat for the show and has been relentlessly plugging it in the build-up to its arrival this morning.\n4: It's A Family Saga But Not Like Dallas Or Dynasty.\nThe sprawling family epic fell from fashion at the end of the 80s, circa the revelation that Bobby Ewing's death was merely a dream and the abduction by aliens of the cast of Dynasty spin-off The Colbys (note to younger readers – this actually happened.). Lately, in fact, family drama has been played for humour: see The Royal Family, Shameless, Mrs B****s Boys. Can the self-serious Bloodline make us care once again about families and their dark secrets?\n5: It's Made For Binge Watching.\nShow-runner Todd Kessler says that, because of Netflix's 'binge-watch' model, Bloodline does not have to hew to the creaky TV convention of each episode ending on a cliff hanger. Even the concept of 'episodes' is a little old hat, he revealed. This is a 13-hour saga, divided into hourly segments yet cohesive and coherent throughout, so that viewers can hopscotch seamlessly from one installment to the next.\n6: It's All About Location.\nThere is a fad in American television for location to serve as a sort of unofficial extra character. Rural Louisiana loomed baroquely in True Detective, for instance and the New Mexico desert imbued Breaking Bad with a whiff of the Apocalypse. In Bloodline, the fetid South Florida Keys, a twilight zone bordering the tropics where people go to escape their safe, suburban lives, conjures a sweltering, slightly manic atmosphere. Without it, Bloodline would be very different.\n7: There Are A Lot Of Flashbacks.\nBloodline is about the secrets family members keep from one other and those they share. So there's a great deal of temporal hopping about, with leaps to an awful event of several years previously and premonitions of a disaster chugging down the tracks. It's confusing at times, sure, but endlessly absorbing with it.\n8: It Takes A While To Get Going.\nHouse of Cards opened with Frank Under",

When they do, you'll be glad you persevered.\n9: You'll Probably Recognise The Main Star Even If You Don't Know His Name.\nThat large-headed actor with the pronounced Southern twang? Yes you've seen him before – he was Coach Taylor in Friday Night Lights, Leonardo DiCaprio's nemesis in Wolf Of Wall Street and Ben Affleck's FBI boss in Argo (bonus fanboy points if you remember him as the vain matinee idol from Peter Jackson's King Kong). His name is Kyle Chandler and Bloodline may well be the role of his career.\nAll 13 episodes of Bloodline season one are available to watch on Netflix now."

        "prompt": "LOS ANGELES — An end to Hollywood’s long and bitter writers’ strike appeared close on Saturday, as union leaders representing 12,000 movie and television writers said they had reached a tentative three-year deal with production companies.\nThe strike, which began Nov. 5, remains in effect until the governing boards of the two writers’ guilds gauge the sense of their membership in mass meetings on both coasts this weekend and decide whether to end the walkout. The mood at the New York meeting on Saturday afternoon was one of supportive optimism, with a touch of wariness, and the Los Angeles gathering was set to take place late in the evening. The boards are expected to meet as early as Sunday, and the strike could be over by Monday morning.\nAn end to the strike would also bring relief to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which was nervously making plans for an Oscar night on Feb. 24 without writers or stars. And late-night talk shows that have operated without writers would benefit immediately. Shows like NBC’s “Late Night with Conan O’Brien” and the “Tonight Show with Jay Leno” are already inviting writers back to work on Monday, assuming the strike ends. Dramas and comedies like Fox’s “24” and “Back to You” are likely to take weeks to get back in production. Weaker shows might not return at all, and shake-ups in network planning might delay the return of others.\nThe agreement would let writers claim to have bettered a similar deal achieved last month between the production companies and the Directors Guild of America. In the third year of the Writers Guild deal, writers will be paid a percentage of the distributor’s revenue rather than the flat fee for Web-streamed television shows granted to the directors. The writers had insisted on this issue to ensure they not lose out on any new-media windfall the studios and networks may get from Web video. The producers yielded on this point — and the directors did not push it —arguing that Internet distribution is unlikely to become a significant business during the length of these contracts.\nWord of the deal came on Saturday in an early morning e-mail message to members of the Writers Guild of America West and the Writers Guild of America East. The deal was to be reviewed by members at previously scheduled meetings here and in New York on Saturday.\nWhile approval appears likely, members have warily debated the expected agreement all week, and they are certain to scrutinize the details closely. Members at the New York meeting on Saturday afternoon appeared largely upbeat, according to a writer who attended but spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid conflict with union leaders. But several questioners said they did not fully understand the contract, and some asked why the unions were being asked to lift the strike so quickly.\nSpokesmen for the writers and for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents over 300 production companies, declined to comment.\nThe strike was, in large part, fought over the contentious issue of compensation for work shown on the Internet and through cell phone and other new-media devices. Writers had demanded a much bigger share of returns from downloads and Web streaming than they had received in the past from the distribution of shows on older media like cassettes and DVDs, as well as expanded jurisdiction over reality television and animated features.\nCompany representatives initially responded by insisting on a complete revamping of Hollywood’s time-honored residuals system, under which writers, directors, actors and others are paid for re-use of their work on television and home video.\nAs the more expansive demands for wider jurisdiction and a narrowing of residuals were dropped, the sides were finally left with a more conventional negotiation. That turned on precise amounts of, and methods for calculating, payments for the growing digital distribution of shows in the next three years.\nIn Hollywood, excitement about a return to work has been dampened by widespread realization that the Screen Actors Guild, which represents 120,000 actors, is approaching a contract negotiation no less difficult than the writers’ talks.\nA memorandum sent to some writers guild members summarized a four-hour meeting on Friday in which union leaders briefed a group of 300 strike captains. According to the memorandum, the captains were deeply divided as to whether the strike should be lifted before a full membership vote.\nIf members balk at an immediate return, the guilds could organize a rapid-fire vote by fax, Web and in meetings, polling writers over the next few days rather than ending the strike by board action. An accelerated member vote might put writers back to work by Wednesday.\nThe tentative agreement became possible when the sides reached a handshake deal nine days ago on a crucial term under which writers would be paid a fixed residual amounting to about $1,300 for the right to stream a television program online. In the third year of their contract, the writers would achieve one of their major goals: payments amounting to 2 percent of the distributor’s revenue from such streams.\nThe percentage formula is viewed by many writers as protection against the possibility that traditional reruns — which have paid them residuals amounting to tens of thousands of dollars per episode in the past — will disappear because of Web streams in the near future.\nOther major gains include a pay plan that pegs residuals for electronic downloads of movies and televisions shows at nearly double the rate paid historically for DVDs, and calculates the rate as a percentage of the distributor’s revenue, junking an old formula.\nThe tentative agreement grew from a week-long, and sometimes heated, exchange of contractual provisions. Informal talks",

According to the memorandum describing the meeting, Mr. Verrone called the failure to win jurisdiction over reality television and animation “a heartbreaking loss for him personally,” though he vowed to continue the fight.\nBill Carter and Colin Moynihan contributed reporting from New York."

The 200-day moving average, a long-term trend line that indicates momentum has been rising every day since May 2016, according to FactSet.\nSince January 1990, 47 of the lowest 56 closing VIX levels have been observed in 2017, as well as two new all-time low closing levels, according to Preston. On Friday, Vix VIX, -4.05% fell nearly 10% to 9.46.\nBut veteran equity analysts should have seen that coming, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, a market research firm.\nLow levels of volatility on the S&P 500 can easily be explained by surprisingly higher levels of volatility in individual stocks and sectors that resulted in falling correlations among industries.\nCorrelation is the degree to which two assets move in relation to each other. Negative correlation means two assets move in opposite direction, while positive correlation means they tend to move in tandem. Zero correlation means assets move independent of each other.\nLow or negative correlations between assets in a portfolio usually reduces overall volatility and enhances returns—in this case of the S&P 500, according to modern portfolio theory.\n“Last November, after presidential elections, correlation between S&P 500 sectors collapsed from about 70% to 50%. The rest is pure math: more variable returns among sectors resulted in lower overall volatility and higher portfolio returns,” Colas said.\nThe average historical correlation between sectors on the S&P 500 is about 50%, according to Colas.\n“That means that 50% of the price can be explained by fundamentals of the industry while the rest is driven by the overall market. But since the financial crisis, all sectors became highly correlated for several year—during which we had risk-on, risk-off days, when everything moved together,” Colas said.\nCorrelations began to decline over the past few years but it was late last year that the decline accelerated, he said.\n“Republican victory in the congress and the White House gave markets hope about easing regulations and cutting taxes. Most importantly, it would remove gridlock that was present for years,”",
        "baseline": " Colas said, referring to the surprise election of President Donald Trump last November.\n“On the index level, markets love gridlock, but not on the sector level. Without gridlock in Washington and fiscal policies impacting businesses, there would be winners and losers, so markets repriced and correlations fell,” Colas said.\nSo, what’s the outlook for volatility and correlations? Just like short-term returns, it is extremely hard to nail down the level of volatility over the next year.\nIf correlations between individual stocks and sectors remain low and barring any unexpected shocks, overall market volatility is unlikely to rise, Colas theorizes.\n“In any given year, VIX tends to peak in January and October, so we could very well see higher Vix during those months next year. I would also expect higher volatility in November if it looks like the Democratic Party is headed for the victory in mid-term congressional elections,” Colas said."

It’s a subject that’s particularly important to me as a lifelong resident of Southern Indiana, where our electric utility, Vectren, has forced consumers to pay the highest electricity rates anywhere in the Midwest — and is now putting forward a plan that would drive those rates even higher.\nWhile Vectren proudly points to essentially flat rates since 2011, those rates are still nearly 40% higher than the Indiana average. Since 2011, Vectren rates have been stable at approximately 15.5 cents/kilowatt-hour. But the average rate for the state of Indiana is 11.31 and was even lower in the past. In fact, Vectren rates are nearly 3 times those charged just across the river in Henderson, Kentucky and 30% higher than Indianapolis Power & Light.\nEnergy powers every part of our lives so high electricity costs have a negative impact on virtually everything we do. Residents in Vectren’s area of coverage who are on a fixed income struggle more than those in areas with more reasonable rates. Businesses are less likely to locate in this area. People are less likely to move here. Property values are lower.\nNow, Vectren is pushing for a plan that would make our electricity prices even higher. It wants to shut down existing generating facilities in order to build a billion dollar natural gas fueled power plant with more capacity.\nIn a time when demand has flattened, excess capacity is not needed.

        "prompt": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released guidelines today for automakers to build nondistracting electronics into cars, but fell short of passing regulations.\nRather than write regulations, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released finalized guidelines for automakers to build cabin electronics into vehicle that will not distract drivers. These guidelines come after a comment period on a draft release by NHTSA last year.\nNHTSA included its responses to comments and the new guidelines in a 281 page PDF made available on its Web site.\nIn justification of the new guidelines, NHTSA revealed that a recent test of distracted driving it conducted showed that texting doubled the risk of a 'near-crash' over attentive driving. While the test found that manually operating a phone also increased the risk of a crash, NHTSA found no increased risk of crash when a driver engaged in a hands-free call.\nNHTSA's statistics also show that undue attention may be placed on distracted driving caused by personal electronics. Of crashes reported between 2006 and 2010, 17 percent were caused by distracted drivers. However, an average of a little over 2 percent of that 17 percent were caused by distraction related to an in-car control, such as a radio or navigation system. And an average of less than 5 percent of that 17 percent were caused by distraction from a portable electronic device, typically a mobile phone.\nIn many ways, NHTSA revised its initial guidelines in response to automaker comments, clarifying or doing away with some particularly onerous or ridiculous measures.\nThe initial release, by proposing no dynamic images visible to the driver, seemed to prohibit the use of modern navigation systems. Responding to objections by manufacturers, NHTSA clarified that it did not intend to mean navigation systems should have static maps. The new guidelines state that maps should not include 'three-dimensional, photographic, full location scenery, and/or satellite images'.\nAudi, Tesla, and BMW offer navigation systems that do show satellite imagery.\nNHTSA justified its guidelines for less complicated map displays by citing a 1995 report on navigation systems by the Federal Highway Administration, apparently ignoring the great strides in technology made over the intervening years.\nAnother issue",
        "baseline": " that arose from the draft guidelines was that cabin electronics, such as a stereo, should show no more than 30 characters on a text display, and that characters should not scroll. NHTSA based the 30-character restriction on guidelines from the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA).\nAutomakers pointed out in comments that the JAMA guideline was based on Kanji characters, an ideogramic language where a single character can represent an entire word. A Kanji sentence of thirty characters could translate to an English sentence of 120 characters.\nNHTSA changed its recommendation to a general prohibition of text from \"books, periodical publications, Web page content, social media content, text-based advertising and marketing, or text-based messages.\"\nNHTSA intends to release two more sets of guidelines, considered Phase 2 and Phase 3 of its distracted driving recommendations. Phase 2 will cover portable electronic devices brought into vehicles, while Phase 3 will cover voice-recognition systems in vehicles."

(he) sped up, like the pilot knew he was short,\" Elliott Stone told CNN.\n\"And then the back end just hit, and flies up in the air, and everybody's head goes up to the ceiling. And then it just kind of drifts for a little bit, for a good 300 yards and then tips over. Fire starts,\" he explained.\nHe said he was able to evacuate safely, sitting in the middle of the plane, but the flight attendants sitting in the back \"got hammered - because we landed short. And then they all fell out - and it was just the most terrible thing I've seen,\" Stone said.\nHe said around 20 minutes after the crash, he and fellow passengers noticed \"another five bodies like 457 metres away that nobody saw,\" adding they alerted emergency workers, but were frustrated at the response. We were yelling at people, yelling at firefighters. Get over here. They were just lagging hard. I don't know.\"\nSurvivor Benjamin Levy told local a local NBC station by phone that he believed the plane had been coming in too low.\n\"I know the airport pretty well, so I realized the guy was a bit too low, too fast, and somehow he was not going to hit the runway on time, so he was too low ... he put some gas and tried to go up again,\" he said.\n\"But it was too late, so we hit the runway pretty bad, and then we started going up in the air again, and then landed again, pretty hard,\" Levy said.\nHe said he opened an emergency door and ushered people out. \"We got pretty much everyone in the back section of the plane out,\" he said. \"When we got out there was some smoke. There was no fire then, the fire came afterward.\"\nOne passenger, a South Korean teenager wearing a yellow T-shirt and plaid shorts, said the plane \"went up and down, and then it hit the ground.\"\n\"The top collapsed on people, so there were many injuries,\" he said, referring to the overhead luggage compartments, before an airport official whisked him back into the Reflection Room, a quiet centre in the airport for thought and meditation.\nAsiana Airlines' chief executive officer Yoon Young-Doo has apologised for the crash and said the plane had no known mechanical problems.\n\"We purchased this aeroplane in March 2006 (and) currently we understand that there are no engine or mechanical problems,\" he told a press conference on Sunday.\nThe ministry said the Boeing 777's tail hit the runway and the aircraft veered to the left off the runway.\n\"Please accept my deepest apology,\" the CEO said, bowing in front of TV cameras at the press conference.\n\"We'll make our utmost efforts to cope with the tragedy.\"\nMr Yoon said the crew had made an in-flight broadcast as usual, \"asking passengers to buckle up for landing. There was no emergency alarm\".\nHe said one pilot had more than 10,000 flying hours, and the other more than 9000.\n\"Our pilots strictly comply with aviation rules,\" the CEO said.\nThe plane, which originated in Shanghai and picked up passengers in South Korea before heading to San Francisco, had 291 passengers and 16 crew on board.\nAmong them, 141 were Chinese nationals, followed by 77 South Koreans, 61 Americans, one Japanese, three Indians, three Canadians, one French, one Vietnamese, three others with unidentified nationality and 16 crew.\nLocal TV station KTVU quoted witnesses as saying that the plane's tail appeared to sheer off as it was coming in to land.\nAnother witness said the tail broke off almost immediately upon hitting what appeared to be the end of the runway .. \"it kind of did a bellyflop landing\".\nOverhead television video about an hour after the crash showed the plane lying off the runway with its fuselage burnt out.\nAnother eyewitness, Anthony Castorani, told CNN that he was watching planes land from his airport hotel when he saw the Asiana Airlines flight coming in for what appeared a routine landing.\n\"The moment it touched down ... there was a large plume of white smoke, you heard a pop and then you immediately saw a large brief fireball that came out from underneath the aircraft,\" he said.\n\"The plane began to cartwheel, and the wing broke off and you could see the tail immediately fly off of the aircraft.\"\nCastorani said that it did not appear that personnel at the airport were expecting an emergency landing, but they rushed to the scene and began dousing the aircraft.\nThe plane appears to have struck the seawall where the runway meets the San Francisco Bay, John Cox, an aviation safety consultant who has participated in several NTSB investigations, said in an interview.\nThat suggests that the plane landed short of the runway, Cox said.\n\"It's not a little bit short,\" Cox said. \"It's a lot short.\"\nOther witnesses said the plane approached the airport at an awkward angle, and it appeared that its tail hit before it bounced down the runway.\nWhen it stopped, they said, passengers had scant time to escape before a blaze burned through the fuselage.\n\"I looked up out the window and saw the plane coming in extremely fast and incredibly heavy,\" said Isabella Lacaze, 18, from Texas, who saw the crash from the San Francisco Airport Marriott Waterfront.\n\"I remember watching the nose go to the ground and the tail way up in the air and then the tail back to ground hard,\" Lacaze said.\nAt that point, she said, the tail snapped off and the rest of the plane skidded down the runway.\n\"The smoke was not bad at all at first,\" she said. \"It was like one cloud. It took maybe a minute or two for the chutes to come out of the side,\" she said, and people began to pour out almost immediately.\nSome passengers scrambled out of the plane even before the chutes deployed, one witness said.\nA number of people lay injured near the wreckage for 20 to 30 minutes before ambulances arrived, Stone said.\nMany people got off relatively unscathed, he said, but he saw at least five people with severe injuries.\nAnxious relatives swarmed around Asiana's headquarters in Seoul, seeking details of the crash and the whereabouts of the victims.\n\"I'm very worried about my daughter. She called me a while ago saying she received injuries to the shoulder and legs,\" a middle-aged woman told journalists.\n\"But since then, I've heard no word from her. I wonder where she is now.\"\nSouth Korean President Park Geun-Hye offered sympathies to victims and their relatives.\n\"I offer my deepest condolences to the victims and their relatives,\" her spokeswoman quoted her as saying.\nIn June 1993 an Asiana Boeing 737 crashed into a mountain in South Korea, killing 68.\nFlame retardant materials inside the plane involved in Saturday's crash, including foil wrapping under the seats, most likely helped protect many passengers said Steven B. Wallace, who was director of the office of accident investigation at the Federal Aviation Administration from 2000 to 2008.\nThe FAA has required the use of such materials for several decades. Wallace said that even though an Air France A340 suffered a worse fire after overrunning a runway in Toronto in 2005, all 309 people on board survived. Only 12 were seriously injured.\n\"It seems clear that the airplane hit short of the runway,\" Wallace said. \"Why that happened, I don't know.\"\nWallace, who is a licensed commercial pilot, said the pilot could have made a mistake and come in too low or there could have been wind shear.\nAn aviation official, who did not want to be identified discussing a developing investigation, said the plane was not making an emergency landing, and the situation had been routine until the crash.\nIf the plane touched down too soon, before the tarmac or before the area intended for landings, it may have torn off its landing gear, and been skidding along on its engine cowlings, said Arnold Reiner, a retired airline captain and the former director of flight safety at Pan Am.\n\"At that point, all bets are off,\" he said, and the tail may have hit the ground with more force than the fuselage was intended to handle.\nOne question for investigators, Reiner said, is who was at the controls.\nThe 777 has a two-pilot cockpit but on a flight that long, there is typically a \"relief pilot\" or two on board, so no one has to work continuously for such a",

        "prompt": "The Tribune's Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs discuss the Bears' 31-3 defeat to the Eagles that dropped them to 3-8 on the season.\n10 thoughts after the Chicago Bears suffered their worst loss of the season on Sunday, losing to the Philadelphia Eagles 31-3 at Lincoln Financial Field.\n1. The No. 1 question that keeps coming in via email and on Twitter is will the Bears fire John Fox and anoint an interim head coach for the remainder of the season?\nFolks have wondered about it for a while and the public demands, rarely something clubs pay particular attention to, are escalating. Before, the first thing I remind people is that the Bears, to my knowledge anyway, have never replaced a head coach during the season. If chairman of the board George McCaskey didn’t demand a change during 2014 when the Bears were outscored 106-37 in consecutive losses to the Patriots and Packers, he’s not going to do anything now, right? Nothing the Bears will stoop to under Fox is going to be as ugly and messy as things got near the end of the Marc Trestman era when you had then offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer breaking bad on quarterback Jay Cutler in private remarks to media and then outing himself as the source of the remarks in a meeting in front of the entire offense. Trestman had no control, commanded next to no respect and the entire thing had run amok. There’s no chance things get that sordid here in the final five weeks.\nThe second thing I would urge you to keep in mind is that while the Bears are 3-8 right now and destined for a fifth consecutive non-winning season, that doesn’t mean the final record will not look a fair bit better. They have remaining games with the 49ers (1-10), Bengals (5-6), Lions (6-5), Browns (0-11) and Vikings (9-2). It’s quite possible the Vikings will have nothing to play for in the season finale at U.S. Bank Stadium on Dec. 31 and if that’s the case, well anything is possible. If your expectations were for much more than a six-win season for the Bears, you’re probably guilty of sipping the Kool-Aid during the offseason, listening to the wrong folks or perhaps both. They could still hit 6-10 even with a rough midseason stretch where they went from looking like they had turned the corner to really hitting the skids.\nCould it happen? Could the Bears pull the trigger on Fox in a move that would put them on the hook for his salary for the remainder of this season and all of next year? Well, that would be one very large parting gift. I suppose there is a chance the Bears make a move but the only case I can make for this happening is if general manager Ryan Pace (and/or McCaskey) believe that Fox has lost the team. Pace certainly doesn’t want to see a string of blowout losses pile up. If that happens, and that’s probably partially what got former GM Phil Emery axed at the end of the 2014 season, Pace could come under a high degree of scrutiny at the end of the season. Make a move now and have more ugly losses follow and the target could expand.\nThe Bears lost eight of their final 10 games in 2014 to finish 5-11. Of those eight losses down the stretch, six were by 13 points or more. Emery’s biggest error, and it’s not even close, was hiring Trestman as coach. When the losses turned lopsided too often, the GM went out the door at the same time.\nFox hasn’t really had that problem this season. He’s got victories over the surging Steelers and Panthers and the losses, by and large, have been respectable. Everyone understands it’s going to take some time with rookie quarterback Mitch Trubisky and injuries have hit the Bears hard and they need to completely rebuild the wide receiver position. But Pace had two years to build this thing up around the quarterback position and the record doesn’t look good right now. Does he push to launch Fox in an effort to re-energize things?\nHonestly, I have a hard time seeing it happen and I realize that doesn’t make fans fed up with the losing product feel better when they would achieve some measure of satisfaction watching someone take the fall.\n2. Brian Baldinger, the former offensive lineman, was at the game as an analyst calling it for SiriusXM and he’s watched a fair bit of tape on the Bears this season. I caught up with the NFL Network analyst before kickoff to ask him about the Bears and if they can turn the corner with a young quarterback like the Eagles have done?\n“I’ve watched a lot of the Bears,” Baldinger said. “First thing, can they ever stay healthy? I have never seen anything like it. It’s year after year that (John) Fox has been there. These guys just keep going down. Leonard Floyd goes down last week and he’s done. And they can’t keep an offensive line healthy. They have pieces. Fox knows how to coach.\n“If you look at what Sean McVay is doing with Jared Goff (for the Rams) there is just so much creativity offensively. I don’t see that in Chicago. I just don’t see it. I know they know how to run the ball. They have no wide receivers. They lose the wide receiver coach (Mike Groh) two years ago. He’s now here (for the Eagles). He’s a good, solid coach. You lose him and then you lose Alshon (Jeffery) and they can’t keep anyone healthy and they’re just taking guys off the street. That’s not helping (Mitch) Trubisky out. The Eagles went out and got two solid receivers. They got Alshon, who has played well, they got Torrey (Smith) and then they drafted this kid Mack Hollins, who has been a real good young player for them and then they run the ball and they’ve got three tight ends they use in different combinations. They built a wall, even with the loss of (left tackle) Jason Peters, they had depth there at offensive line. They put a lot of depth there so even when Peters went down, even when (right tackle) Lane Johnson was suspended last year, they had a good line in front of Carson Wentz. The quarterback is really good.\n3. Boy, the Bears put Cairo Santos in a tough spot in his first game with his new team. When they asked him to try a 54-yard field goal from the left hashmark late in the first quarter, it looked like the request was definitely beyond his range when you consider the conditions – winds were whipping at 17 mph when the game started. Santos was short and wide right. He came back and hit a 38-yarder later in the game and he’s been known for accuracy throughout his career.\nShortly after Santos signed with the Bears last Monday, he received a text congratulating him from Chiefs special teams coordinator Dave Toub. It was a special message for Santos, who played for Toub for three seasons and then the first three games of this season before suffering a groin injury.\nSantos was an undrafted free agent from Tulane when he made the Chiefs as a rookie in 2014. He never would have been available for the Bears had he not re-aggravated the groin injury he originally suffered in preseason.\nThe Chiefs had secured Santos as a restricted free agent for this season, meaning he was earning $1.797 million when he was waived/injured Sept. 30. Santos was paid for the first three weeks and then received a six-week settlement.\nGetting to that point where he felt fully healed, within the last two weeks, took some time. And it required some patience.\nThe one-year contract Santos signed with the Bears, he’s earning the pro-rated portion of the $690,000 minimum for a veteran in his fourth season, sets Santos up to enter free agency in March. Provided he remains healthy, his production during his first three seasons in Kansas City will likely put him in position to receive a nice pay day.\n“We're excited to have him in our program and we're hopeful it can be a long-term addition,” general manager Ryan Pace announced on the team’s web site.\nIf Santos performs well the next five weeks, I’d expect the Bears to see if they can get something done. It would check a box for them heading into an offseason when there are lot larger boxes that need to be checked. One other good thing from the game for Santos? He got touchbacks on both kickoffs.\n4. There was some reaction following the game after right guard Kyle Long was asked about the Eagles’ celebrations during the game. After Alshon Jeffery scored a touchdown with five seconds remaining in the second quarter to put Philadelphia ahead 24-0, Jeffery pretended to knock over teammates with a bowling ball. In the second half, the Eagles broke out the Electric Slide.\nGuess what? If the Bears had been scoring touchdowns and generating takeaways with a comfortable lead, I’m pretty sure they would have broken out a few moves.\nIf the Bears find a way to win some games, surely they will bust a move. After all, you see it in just about every game, every Sunday. This isn’t some new wave way of disrespecting the opponent. Just ask defensive end Akiem Hicks.\n“If you do not want them to do it, just stop them,” Hicks said.\n5. Chris Long feels bad for his younger brother Kyle. He’s been through rough seasons, worse ones than Kyle has experienced. The Rams were a disaster for much of the time Chris was in St. Louis as the No. 2 overall pick by the organization back in 2008. He’s had seasons marred by injury like his younger brother.\n“Listen, I have been on some teams that went 1-15, 2-14,” Chris Long said. “I certainly know where he is coming from. The reason we came to play today the way we did is we respect that team and they’re coached to play hard, up front they play hard and they run the football. That running back is real special which makes what we did today, I think something we can be proud of. We’ll dissect it.\nChris Long deserves some serious props for how he’s gone about things this year. Before the season started, he announced that he was donating his first six game checks to fund scholarships to St. Anne’s-Belfield School in Charlottesville, Va., where he attended. The money is earmarked to fund scholarships for two members of the Boys & Girls Club of Central Virginia for sixth through 12th grade at the school – seven-year scholarships.\n“I kind of had a feeling I might do something with all my checks but the first six were, the number became arbitrary because it had more to do with how many scholarships I was funding in my hometown,” Long said.\nThen, Long announced he was donating the remainder of his game checks for the season – his base salary is $1 million – to charities in St. Louis, Boston and Philadelphia. Yes, Long is effectively playing for free this season a year after winning a Super Bowl ring with the Patriots. Well, not quite free. He got a $750,000 roster bonus and a $500,000 signing bonus, but he’s still forking over $1 million of the $2.25 million he signed for this season. That’s 44.4 percent to charities, causes that he really believes in.\n“After (the six game checks) I really wanted to do something more wide ranging so we came up with this ‘Pledge 10 for Tomorrow’ initiative,” he said. “It’s given to four groups in three cities that deal with underserved kids in education as far as opportunity and equity.\nI told Long, who also started Waterboys, a group that raises money to build wells and provide clean water to east African countries, it’s cool to see him stepping forward in such a way.\n“Listen, I am lucky to have this platform,” he said.\n6. The Eagles are riding high as you know, having won nine straight games now. Right tackle Bobby Massie made an interesting comparison after the game when he said, “they’re just like the 2015 Carolina Panthers.” Massie was playing for the Cardinals then and Carolina blew out Arizona in the NFC Championship Game to reach the Super Bowl. Philadelphia is experiencing some great success and we’ll see how far the Eagles go. It’s a wild year in the NFC. The Cowboys look crushed following the suspension of running back Ezekiel Elliott. The Packers are really struggling with quarterback Aaron Rodgers out. The Seahawks have suffered a slew of injuries. If the Eagles make a deep push, other clubs could come calling. Former Bears college scouting director Joe Douglas could quickly become a general manager candidate. He is the vice president of player personnel and with Howie Roseman wielding the most power (and control of the 53-man roster) as executive vice president of football operations, Douglas could be hired away as a GM. Pro personnel director Dwayne Joseph, a scout in two stints for the Bears, could see his name get some push. Quarterbacks coach John DeFilippo might be an emerging young head coaching candidate. DeFilippo was blocked from interviewing to be the Jets offensive coordinator this past offseason but nothing could stop the Eagles from stopping another team from meeting with him about a head coaching shot. So stay tuned to see how popular the folks behind the scenes with the Eagles become after the season.\n7. The Bears throttled back with defensive end Akiem Hicks this week and that was probably a wise move after a knee injury that took him off the field for two plays last week against the Lions led to him missing practice on Wednesday and Thursday. Hicks was on the field for 54 of 78 snaps after logging an almost unheard of 186 of 190 in the previous three games. It’s difficult for a player to give maximum effort on every snap with that much action and playing that much could reduce Hicks’ effectiveness. He was getting some time on the sideline even before the game was completely out of hand in the fourth quarter. Jonathan Bullard, who had lost playing time recently, got 47 snaps and recorded a sack.\nJohn Jenkins, who has been active for only two other games this season, logged 22 snaps.\n8. Even with the return of tight end Dion Sims after missing the previous two games because of illness, the club didn’t cut into the workload too much for rookie Adam Shaheen. That’s a good thing. Shaheen needs more action down the stretch so he can use this as a building block heading into Year 2. Sims was on the field for 20 of the 55 offensive snaps and Shaheen got 17 with Daniel Brown getting 30in the third-down package that was used quite a bit in the fourth quarter. For what it’s worth, running back Tarik Cohen was on the field for 19 snaps and still disappointing wide receiver Markus Wheaton had 55 snaps.\n9. Deiondre’ Hall was at Halas Hall on the players’ day off Tuesday working on the Jugs machine catching ball after ball after ball when he got the call. That is when the team informed the safety he would begin practicing the next day, designated to return from injured reserve. Hall practiced this week and the Bears could move him to the 53-man roster any time between now and Dec. 13. By then the team either needs to move Hall to the 53 or shut him down for the remainder of the season on IR.\nThe second-year player from Northern Iowa suffered a hamstring injury in the preseason finale against the Browns. The team converted him from cornerback to safety at the start of the offseason and it’s difficult to figure how he would earn playing time on defense but certainly he could factor on special teams.\nIt’s a chance for Hall to do something, even if it’s playing a small role, to prevent this from being a lost season.\n“I want to make the best out of my opportunity whether that is getting back and playing, whether that is staying on scout team, whatever it is,” he said.\nHall worked with the scout team in practice this past week. It’s possible the Bears are waiting for an injury to necessitate a roster move to bump Hall up. Fellow safety Quintin Demps is eligible to be designated to return at any point now as well. When and if that will happen, I can’t say right now but Demps is the most likely of the remaining players on IR to have a shot at returning. He suffered a fractured left arm in the Week 3 victory over the Steelers. Plenty of people have asked time and time again: I haven’t gotten any indication wide receiver Kevin White can or will return from IR this season. Stay tuned on this front.\n10. The Bears opened as a 5 ½-point favorite over the 49ers for Sunday’s game at Soldier Field at Westgate SuperBook. It will be interesting to see if Arlington Heights native Jimmy Garoppolo will make his first start for San Francisco in this game. That would be something for the former Eastern Illinois star.",
        "baseline": "\n10a. There is a chance the Bears will finish the season without a single player having 500 receiving yards. Kendall Wright is closest with 345. That puts him on pace for 502. The next closest is Tarik Cohen with 267 yards.\n10b. I need to re-watch the action but on first glance it didn’t appear to be the best game for rookie free safety Eddie Jackson.\n10d. Former Bears coach Marc Trestman was named the CFL Coach of the Year for the second time in his career. His Toronto Argonauts won the 105th Grey Cup Sunday night with a 27-24 victory over the Calgary Stampeders. Trestman previously won a Grey Cup in 2009 and 2010. The Argonauts were 5-13 last year.\n10e. The CBS crew of Andrew Catalon and James Lofton will call Sunday’s game against the 49ers at Soldier Field, a cross-flexed game that was shifted off Fox."

        "prompt": "Can Container Store Start 2015 on a Positive Note?\nIn 2014, it was hard to find bad-performing stocks, as the market put in a sixth straight year of gains. For Container Store Group , though, its first full year as a public company was a disaster for investors, with the stock plunging almost 60% last year. Amid falling same-store sales and worrisome trends in overall revenue, confidence in Container Store&apos;s future prospects took a huge hit. Yet as shares have started to stabilize, though, shareholders hope that the worst is over for the company and that customers might return in force to take advantage of the retail chain&apos;s organizational products. Moreover, some enthusiasm both from the professional analyst camp and from an activist hedge fund could help support the stock in the future. Let&apos;s take an early look at what&apos;s been happening with Container Store over the past quarter and what it&apos;s likely to say in its earnings report on Thursday afternoon.\nCan Container Store get its earnings organized better this quarter?Investors are more pessimistic than they were a few months ago about Container Store&apos;s earnings, having slashed their views on November-quarter earnings by 30%. Yet even though the stock has fallen 14% since early October, share prices have bounced off their lowest levels since then.\nJust about all of the damage done to Container Store&apos;s stock came following its fiscal second-quarter report. On its face, 39% growth in adjusted net income seemed like a reasonably promising performance, coming from a 5.2% rise in net revenue. Yet comparable store sales were actually down 0.4% for the quarter, showing just how important Container Store&apos;s continued expansion has been to its overall growth. Overhead costs rose at a faster pace than revenue, and Container Store cut its guidance for full-year revenue by about $20 million and gave lower predictions of earnings per share than shareholders were looking to see. With comps also predicted to fall again this quarter, the stock plunged 25% in a single day following the announcement.\nSince then, Container Store has finally drawn some interest. In late October, a presentation from activist hedge fund Apex Capital highlighted its 4.5% ownership interest in Container Store, with Apex&apos;s founder exploring options such as encouraging faster growth, expense reductions, and even considering selling the company in a going-private transaction. With private-equity company Leonard Green & Partners holding a majority stake in Container Store, Apex will have to convince its institutional peer that its suggested plan of action has merit for the company.\nMoreover, some investors simply believe that Container Store&apos;s stock is cheap enough to be attractive. In November, analysts at Merrill Lynch upgraded the organizational-goods company, highlighting some of Container Store&apos;s plans to execute a turnaround of its sluggish sales and drive more customers into its stores.\nOne long-term concern that investors need to consider is whether potential cost-cutting moves could endanger Container Store&apos;s renowned corporate culture. The company prides itself on treating its employees well, with generous salaries of roughly double the average in the retail industry. Many argue that treating its employees well leads to better results for Container Store, but without solid earnings growth, reducing compensation costs would be a tempting way for an institutional investor",
        "baseline": " to push more money down to the bottom line quickly.\nIn the Container Store earnings report, be sure to watch whether the company further reduces guidance.

If Container Store can&apos;t deliver an optimistic message this time around, its stock could easily end up headed downward once again.\nThe article Can Container Store Start 2015 on a Positive Note? originally appeared on Fool.com.\nDan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

        "prompt": "Akiko Gharbi | Police officers protesting on the Pont de la Concorde, by the French National Assembly, on October 26, 2016.\nHundreds of police officers converged on the National Assembly in central Paris on Wednesday to protest an ever-increasing workload, outdated equipment and rules restricting their ability to defend themselves.\nThe protest follows almost 10 days of nightly demonstrations in cities across France, spontaneously organised on social media by officers who view both the government and the police hierarchy as “out of touch”.\nAt the end of the day’s protest, the government promised an extra €250 million, and a review of officers’ rights to defend themselves when under attack.\nEarlier, a small group of protesting officers, off duty from their normal beat in Versailles, told FRANCE 24 they were “at the end of their tether” after “decades of neglect by changing governments that have eroded our ability to function properly in a job we love”.\n“We work in filthy, run-down police stations, we have to provide much of our own equipment – business cards and even pens. We don’t have up-to-date communications or radio equipment and we are expected to rely almost completely on our private mobile phones,” said Alexandre Langlois, standing in the crowd of some 600 off-duty officers on the Pont de la Concorde outside the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament.\n“Above all, we are restricted in what we are allowed to do to defend ourselves when we are under attack,” he said.\nThe wave of protests that began 10 days ago was sparked by an attack on four officers by a gang armed with Molotov cocktails. Two officers were seriously wounded, and one of them remains in a serious condition in hospital.\nLangois’ colleague Nicolas explained that under their rules of engagement – identical to civilian rules governing self-defence – the officer had “probably been too afraid to use his weapon”.\n“I have never once used my sidearm in my 10 years on the job, and I hope I never have to,” he added, to vigorous agreement from his colleagues standing on either side of him.\nJessy, part of the group gathered on Pont de la Concorde amid some 600 fellow officers, insisted their protest was “not about money; we don’t want a euro more”.\n“But I shouldn’t be expected to have to buy my own bullet-proof vest, which I have done, and as a keeper of the peace I should be allowed to protect myself,” he said.\nThey also insisted that their protest was non-political. The small group of Versailles officers jeered at the few politicians, mostly representing the conservative opposition Les Républicains and far-right National Front parties, milling around with the protesting officers and lining up to speak to journalists covering the event.\nSeveral of these politicians – conspicuous in the red, white and blue sashes that French officials sometimes wear – denied that they were there to gain political capital, with Les Républicains deputy Laure de la Raudière saying she",
        "baseline": " had joined the protests simply to “show my support”. They chimed in enthusiastically as officers sang the Marseillaise national anthem.\nThe protesting officers were also proud that their protest movement, organised almost entirely on social media, did not have the backing of their trade unions until this week.\nNevertheless, it will be the police unions – who belatedly called for members to join Wednesday’s protest – who will be received by the government this evening.\nLate on Wednesday, the protesting officers were vindicated when Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve announced that the police would receive an extra €250 million in funding for updated equipment, and promised an inquiry into police officers’ rights to self defence.\nUnions hailed the announcement as “very significant”, but warned that “concrete measures will have to be made quickly”.\nA poll published Wednesday by French daily Le Figaro showed that 90% of French citizens support the police protests."

But people fear that once the Fed steps back, rates will inevitably rise.\nIndeed, mortgage rates have recently risen from their record lows. Last week, average rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit 3.98%, up from 3.35% in early May, according to mortgage giant Freddie Mac.\nThe recent rate increase amounts to about $100 more a month on a $300,000 mortgage, totaling $36,000 more over the course of 30 years, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, a mortgage information company.\nUnlike most consumer lending, mortgage rates are tied to long-term interest rates. While they probably won't climb much further, they are unlikely to fall back to record lows, he said.\nMeanwhile, most borrowers will likely continue to enjoy rock-bottom rates on everything from auto loans to private student loan bills.\nOf course, there's a downside to low interest rates: savers get stuck with measly returns from savings accounts and low-risk investments like CDs. The low rates have been particularly hard on retirees living on fixed incomes",

Even when long-term interest rates start moving up, the Fed has committed to keeping short-term rates near zero until the economy strengthens considerably.\nIn turn, the so-called \"prime rate,\" the interest rate around which banks lend to their best customers and the most common benchmark used for setting credit card and other loan rates, has been stuck at 3.25% for years.\nWhile borrowers with poor credit have seen credit card rates increase slightly this year, rates for consumers with excellent credit have continued to fall. Some have been offered interest rates in the single digits or 0% introductory offers for lengthy trial periods, said John Kiernan, senior analyst at Cardhub.com, a credit comparison site."

The Bulls used the Wolves’ seventh pick to acquire Arizona 7-foot shooter Lauri Markkanen.\nA year after the two teams discussed such a trade, Thibodeau and General Manager Scott Layden pulled off their first one together.\nIt’s a big one, too — just behind the one in team history that sent superstar Kevin Garnett to Boston in 2007 and probably even with the 2014 trade that sent away Kevin Love and brought Andrew Wiggins.\nIn trading for Jimmy Butler on Thursday night, the Wolves get a three-time All-Star and a physical perimeter defender who turns 28 in September.\nButler gives the Wolves an experienced, physical defender to put beside young stars Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns, both of whom could use some defensive tutoring from one of the league’s best in that department.\nGiven the NBA’s current economics, Butler is a bona fide star signed to a relative bargain contract that pays him $18.7 million this coming season and $19.8 million in 2018-19. He has a $19.8 million player option in 2019-20.\nApparently, Butler will be missed in Chicago.\nTo get Butler back, the Wolves traded LaVine, the 13th player taken in the 2014 and a two-time All-Star dunk contest winner who’s recovering from February knee surgery. They also dealt Dunn, the fifth player in last year’s draft whom the Bulls coveted when the two teams discussed a Butler trade on draft day in 2016.\nThibodeau lauded Dunn’s development more than once when he and Layden held a pre-draft media briefing on Wednesday.\nDuring that briefing, Thibodeau identified the Wolves’ biggest needs as shooting, defense and toughness, and Butler provides all three, but those final two qualities in particular.\nThe last player (30th overall) selected in the 2011 draft’s first round, Butler will turn 28 in September.\nHe was raised in Tomball, Texas, and in Chicago wore uniform No. 21, which was former Wolves superstar Kevin Garnett’s number throughout his Wolves’ career.\nWhen ESPN reached him by telephone about 2 a.m. Friday Paris time, Butler declined to comment. He’s expected to be introduced as a Timberwolf in the middle of next week.\nButler won the NBA’s Most Improved Player award in 2015 after he increased his scoring average from 13.1 points a game to 20 points a game.\nHe accepted that award about the same time the Bulls fired Thibodeau after five years as their coach. The divorce between Thibodeau and Bulls management ended messily, but",

He said he hopes his team will now do that, too.\n“It sets our course and what we need to do,” Paxson said.\nA 6-7 forward, Butler has played all his six NBA seasons in Chicago.

Doom-and-gloom research like this always requires a hefty grain of salt, but after speaking with numerous industry experts an entire shaker might be necessary.\nImperva looked at a variety of security solutions from such vendors as Kaspersky, Avast, AVG, Microsoft, and McAfee, to name a few. They pitted these sentinels against 82 randomly collected malware samples, examining how successful the security software was in detecting the rogue software.\nFrom their work, Imperva asserts that anti-malware software is not fast or responsive enough to combat modern threats. Security software, writes Imperva, is \"much better at detecting malware that spreads rapidly in massive quantities of identical samples, while variants that are of limited distribution (such as government sponsored attacks) usually leave a large window of opportunity.\"\nThey also found no correlation between the money users spend on virus protection and the security provided by software, and suggest that both individual and enterprise customers look at freeware alternatives.\nThe study has garnered a lot of attention, but when speaking with security professionals, and some of the companies named in the study, Security Watch found many who believe the study to be deeply flawed.\nJust about every lab or security company felt that Imperva's sample size of malware was too small to support the conclusions made by the study. AV-Test's Andreas Marx told us that his firm receives about a million samples of new, unique malware per week. Similarly, Peter Stelzhammer from AV-Comparatives told us that they receive 142,000 new malicious files each day.\nFor their part, Imperva wrote in the study that they intentionally used a small sampling, but insist that it is demonstrative of existing threats. \"Our selection of malware was not biased but was randomly taken from the Web reflecting a potential method for constructing an attack,\" writes Imperva.\nNSS Labs research director Randy Abrams, however, had a sharply different interpretation of Imperva's methodology. \"Searching for filenames is guaranteed to miss sophisticated attacks and most other malware too,\" Abrams told Security Watch, commenting on the means Imperva used to locate malware for the study. \"Focusing on Russian forums significantly biases the sample collection. It is obvious that no thought went into obtaining a real-world, representative samples set.\"\nTo carry out their study, Imperva used the online tool VirusTotal to perform their tests which was cited as a critical weakness of the test. \"The problem with this test is that it ripped threats, in the form of executable files, and then scanned those using VirusTotal,\" said Simon Edwards of Dennis Labs. \"VT is not a suitable system to use when evaluating anti-malware products largely because the scanners used in VT are not supported by additional technology such as web reputation systems.\"\nKaspersky Labs, whose product was used in the study, also questioned the testing methodology employed by Imperva in the experiment. \"When scanning for potentially dangerous files, the VirusTotal service used by Imperva's specialists does not use the full versions of antivirus products, but merely relies on a standalone scanner,\" wrote Kaspersky Labs in a statement issued to Security Watch.\n\"This approach means that the majority of protection technologies available in modern antivirus software are simply ignored. This also affects proactive technologies designed to detect new, unknown threats.\"\nNotably, a portion of VirusTotal's website discourages anyone from using their service in antivirus analysis. The company's 'About' section reads, \"we are tired of repeating that the service was not designed as a tool to perform antivirus comparative analyses [...] Those who use VirusTotal to perform antivirus comparative analyses should know that they are making many implicit errors in their methodology.\"\nAbrams also took a dim view on using VirusTotal to perform the study, saying that the tool can be used to skew results towards those desired by testers. \"Competent, experienced testers know better than to use VirusTotal to assess protection abilities of anything other than a pure command line scanner,\" he said.\nImperva defended the use of VirusTotal in their study. \"The essence of the report is not a comparison of antivirus products,\" writes Imperva. \"Rather, the purpose is to measure the efficacy of a single antivirus solution as well as combined antivirus solutions given a random set of malware samples.\"\nWhile the experts we spoke with agreed that zero-day vulnerabilities and newly created malware are a problem, none supported Imperva's assertions about timing or low detection rates. \"The lowest protection rates during a 'real-world' zero-day test are 64-69 percent,\" Marx told Security Watch. \"On average, we saw a protection rate of 88-90 percent for all tested products, this means, 9 out of 10 attacks will be successfully blocked, only 1 will actually cause an infection.\"\nAnother key conclusion of the Imperva report was that anti-malware software is well understood by malware creators, who tweak their creations to subvert protection systems. \"Attackers understand antivirus products in depth, become familiar with their weak points, identify antivirus product's strong points, and understand their methods for handling the high incidence of new virus propagation in the Internet,\" writes Imperva in the study.\nThe study continues, \"variants that are of limited distribution (such as government sponsored attacks) usually leave a large window of opportunity.\"\n\"The malware guys are really tough, they're strong and intelligent,\" said Stelzhammer. \"A targeted attack is always dangerous.\" But he and others stressed that targeted attacks where the malware is specifically tailored against anti-malware is as rare as it is dangerous.\nThe effort and information required to create a piece of malware to defeat every layer of protection is great. \"Such a test requires a lot of time and skills, so they are not cheap,\" wrote Marx. \"But that's the reason why they are called 'targeted.'\"\nOn this point, Abrams quipped, \"Frankly, I am really not concerned with Stuxnet getting into my computer and attacking a uranium enriching centrifuge at my home or employer's office.\"\nNearly everyone we spoke to agreed, at least in principle, that free anti-malware solutions could provide worthwhile protection for users. However, most disagreed that it was a viable option for enterprise customers. Stelzhammer points out that even if corporate users wanted to use free software, the licensing agreements sometimes prevent them from doing so.\n\"It's not all about detection,\" said Stelzhammer in an interview with Security Watch. \"It's about administration, it's about rolling out to the clients, its about overview. You will not get this with a free product.\"\nAn informed user at home, continued Stelzhammer, could use layers of free software to provide protection comparable to paid software but at the cost of simplicity. \"He can arrange a well protected system with free software, but the biggest advantage of paid software is convenience.\"\nHowever, Edwards of Dennis Labs disagreed with the favorable comparison with free software. \"This is counter to all of our findings over many years of testing,\" said Edwards. \"Almost without exception the best products are paid",
        "baseline": "-for.\" These findings are similar to PC Magazine's testing of anti-malware software.\nSince the publication of the study last month, Imperva has written a blog post defending their position. Speaking to Security Watch, Imperva director of security strategy Rob Rachwald said, \"Any critique focusing on our methodology is missing the reality we see today.\" He went on to say that most data breaches are the result of malware intrusion, which the company sees as proof that the current anti-malware model is simply not working.\nWhile there may be some inherent truth to Imperva's conclusions, none of the experts we spoke with viewed the study positively. \"Typically, I warn against vendor sponsored tests, but if this test had been performed by an independent organization I would warn against the organization itself,\" wrote Abrams of NSS Labs. \"It is rare that I encounter such an incredibly unsophisticated methodology, improper sample collection criteria, and unsupported conclusions wrapped up in a single PDF.\""

        "prompt": "Astronauts lift our spirits. But can we afford to send humans into space?\nAmerica’s first step in its attempt to reconquer worlds beyond our planet ended in spectacular success on Friday. An unmanned version of its Orion spacecraft soared more than 3,000 miles into space before splashing down on target in the Pacific ocean. The flight was hailed by Nasa, which says that the spaceship is destined to be the first of a fleet that will carry humans to the Moon, Mars and beyond.\nIn many laboratories and research centres, this delight was shared by scientists. A return to sending men and women to other parts of the solar system – years after the US scrapped its last manned space vehicle, the shuttle – cannot come soon enough for them.\nBut for others, the test flight was viewed as a distinctly unhappy event. Putting humans into space is futile, expensive and ultimately harmful to real science, argue researchers who believe that robot craft represent the future of space exploration and are dismayed by the US’s commitment to return to expensive manned missions.\nScientists like Weinberg point to missions such as Europe’s Rosetta and Philae probes which have successfully begun an exploration of Comet 67P. They argue that these missions represent the real future of the solar system’s exploration. Men and women will remain expensive nuisances when it comes to discovering other worlds, they say. Relatively cheap robot probes are the future.\nThe existence of these two camps – manned versus unmanned – reveal a deep division in attitude to space exploration. On one hand, enthusiasts such as astronomer Professor Ian Crawford of Birkbeck College, London, believe that, although modern robots are capable of highly sophisticated tasks, only humans can carry out some forms of exploration.\nCrawford envisages setting up a handful of lunar colonies that would mirror the establishment of research bases in the Antarctic. From these, small numbers of astronauts would survey the lunar landscape, make observations and collect samples.\n“These missions would use robot vehicles as assistants but would depend on human intuition and leadership,” he said. “Humans and robots would work together.” And after the Moon, targets such as Mars and possibly the asteroids would be explored in a similar manner, he added.\nThis vision is not shared by all scientists. Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, believes the cost of putting humans in space is harder to justify because of the rising sophistication of robots. “If you look at the great discoveries that have already been made in the solar system’s exploration, the vast majority have been carried out by robot probes: the discovery of the great hydrocarbon lakes on Saturn’s moon, Titan, and the discovery of the underground ocean on another of its moons, Enceladus, are good examples,” he said.\nFrom this perspective, relying on humans to carry out scientific exploration in space is unjustified, a point emphasised by Weinberg, who describes the International Space Station – claimed by Nasa to be an orbiting multidisciplinary laboratory – as “an orbital turkey”.\nNo important science has ever emerged from it with the exception of one cosmic ray experiment which could easily have been done on an unmanned satellite, he believes. Indeed, he adds, the whole manned spaceflight programme, which is so enormously expensive, has produced very little of scientific value.\nManned space flight crowds out real science, Weinberg argues. As an example, he points out that in 2004, president George W Bush announced a new vision of manned space missions for Nasa in which the agency would return to the Moon then head on to Mars. A few days later, Nasa revealed it was making major cutbacks in its programmes of unmanned research in astronomy because they “do not clearly support the goals of the president’s vision for space exploration”. In other words, to support manned missions science projects were cut back.\nEven worse, says Weinberg, was the example of the US Superconducting Super-Collider, which was designed to study the structure of matter by crashing sub-atomic particles into each other at colossal energies. Its $12bn construction, in Texas, was cancelled in 1993 because Congress decided the US could not build the SSC and the International Space Station, of which the US was the main supporter of funds, at the same time. So it chose to build the space station, mainly for political reasons.\nThis left Europe free to build its own Large Hadron Collider, at Cern, Geneva, a decade later, where scientists discovered the Higgs Boson in 2013 and are set to begin the search for dark matter and other exotic particles when the LHC reopens next year after a refit.\nBy contrast, the US ended up with that “orbital turkey”, a decision described by Weinberg as a tragic mistake. “The only real technology that the space station has produced concerns the technology of keeping humans alive in space – which is a senseless and circular process if you realise there is no point in having humans in space,” he said.\nSo are science and manned spaceflight virtually incompatible? No, says Crawford. For a start, the idea of robot efficiency is a myth, he says, as there is no substitute for putting a person into space to get things done. “Just consider Philae,” he said. “It did bounce when it landed on comet 67P and in the end only carried out a couple of days’ work – albeit very, very important work – before it stopped working. By contrast, if we had had a bigger mission, with humans on board, the pilot would have been able to land it expertly on that tricky terrain.\nThe difference in scientific return rates from manned and unmanned missions is vividly illustrated by the Apollo 17 mission, flown by astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt in 1972, and the robot rover Opportunity which, in 2004, was dropped on to the surface of Mars and has been exploring ever since, said Crawford. “Apollo 17 spent three days on the Moon while its astronauts made journeys across the lunar surface that totalled 31 kilometres,” he said. “They also drilled a three-metre hole into the surface, the deepest made in an object outside Earth, left a range of instrument packages behind them, and then brought back a 76kg of rock back to Earth.\nThe contrast between the scientific returns of the two approaches is revealed by examining the number of scientific papers based on the Apollo missions, says Crawford. These vastly outnumber the papers produced from all the robot missions that have been carried out on the Moon and Mars. And the number of publications based on Apollo sample is still rising. “Its scientific legacy has been far greater than any other mission we have made to another world,” said Crawford.\nIt was a legacy that was bought at a considerable price, however. The Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s cost $25bn –more than $100bn today. From this perspective, manned missions are more than 100 times more expensive than robot missions, it is calculated. In the early days of spaceflight, there was little alternative to putting humans in spacecraft. But now robotics has achieved an advanced status and is constantly becoming more sophisticated. Martian rovers can navigate rocky terrains, drill holes and analyse soil samples – using 20th-century technology.\nIn short, the jury is still out over the future of humans in space. However, one thing is clear: we may one day return to other worlds, like the Moon and maybe Mars, but current global economic problems suggest these trips will happen later rather than sooner.\nYuri Gagarin became the first human to fly in space when he orbited the Earth in his Vostok spacecraft on 12 April 1961. His mission was followed by a series of flights - by the US and the Soviet Union - of larger and larger capsules. These culminated in the lunar landings of the US Apollo programme in the late 60s and early 70s.\nThe 12 men who landed on the Moon on Apollo spacecraft are the only humans to have walked on another world.\nAfter the Apollo programme was brought to a premature close, largely due to lack of",
        "baseline": " public interest in the US, America concentrated its efforts on constructing a fleet of reusable space shuttles. These were intended to become the nation’s primary means of launching payloads into orbit and were to be launched once a week when fully operational according to Nasa’s ambitious timetable. The first shuttle, Columbia, was launched on 12 April 1981.\nThirty years later the fleet was retired after a total of only 135 flights - including two catastrophic accidents which destroyed the shuttles Challenger and Columbia and killed each of their seven-person crews.\nSince then, the only craft capable of carrying astronauts to the International Space Station has been Russia’s Soyuz space capsule.\nAt the same time the Chinese have pursued their own manned spaceflight programme, which began in 2003, when Yang Liwei became the first person sent into space by the Chinese space programme after orbiting the Earth 14 times in his Shenzhou 5 capsule, making China the third country to independently send humans into space."

        "prompt": "Meet Google's Robot Army. It's Growing.\nGoogle can't stop buying robotics companies. In the past two months, eight of the 12 companies the search giant has acquired have \"robotics\" in their name or descriptions. Here's your complete breakdown of the robot army presently at Google's command.\nAs stated in the midst of its buying spree, the company's largely letting its new robotics divisions continue to work on their preexisting projects, and why wouldn't they? The newly acquired companies are doing a damn good job. They're even winning competitions.\nRobot technology would help with self-driving cars, certainly, but the range of these acquisitions hints at even broader ambitions. Again, we don't know much. They're all a part of the Google X division, which is top secret by definition. We do know what the new companies in the Google family are up to, though, and that might offer us some clues.\nThese guys are rockstars. The Japanese team that got its start at Tokyo University just took the top prize at DARPA's Robotics Challenge Trial thanks to the cunning and agility of its 5-foot, 5-inch, 209-pound bipedal robot. After being purchased by Google in early December 2013, Schaft's blue machine proved to be the best at walking on uneven terrain, climbing ladders, clearing debris, and connecting hoses, ultimately scoring an impressive 27 out of 32 possible points.\nThe company was originally founded to build disaster response robots after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 but has since broadened its scope, thanks in part to funding from the U.S. government. Who knows how far they'll go floating on Google's coffers?\nIndustrial Perceptions, Inc., is an imaging company that spun off of the Menlo Park robotics company Willow Garage. Before being acquired by Google in December—the day after the Schaft acquisition, in fact—IPI was focusing on building advanced technology for 3D vision-guided robots to be used in manufacturing and logistics. This includes the ability to see and sort different objects, say, in a factory. You could imagine a company like Amazon being very interested in this kind of technology, but it's so far unclear exactly what Google wants to do with it.\nRedwood Robotics started as a joint venture between Meka Robotics, SRI International, and Willow Garage, IPI's parent. And like IPI, it's always had a very focused mission. Redwood wants to build the \"next generation arm\" for robots. Meka Robotics founder Aaron Edsinger once said that he wants to do for robotic arms what the Apple II did for computers. Specifically, Redwood wants to build robotic arms that can work alongside people even in the comfort of their own home. That also means being the common arm manufacturer of service robots, so in the future, everybody's personal robot could have Redwood arms. Well, make that Google arms.\nLike its cousin, Redwood Robotics, Meka is dedicated to building robots that can live and work with human beings. The company describes its flagship model, the M1 Mobile Manipulator, as having \"human-safe, human-soft, and human scale robot technologies that will enable the robots of tomorrow to work alongside people in the home and the workplace.\" The human-like faces on the robot can even emote, a feature that's as creepy as you let it be.\nEven before joining Google, Holomini was a pretty secretive outfit. All we really know from its now shuttered website is the company describes itself as \"Creators of high-tech wheels for omnidirectional motion.\" The image above is just a stock photo guesstimate of what a \"high-tech wheel for omnidirectional motion\" might look like.\nIf Redwood and IPI are the engineers in the family, Bot & Dolly are the artists. The company describes itself as \"a design and engineering studio that specializes in automation, robotics, and filmmaking\" with a mission \"to advance motion control and automation as a creative medium.\" In reality, this means that Bot and & Dolly use robots to help film commercials and movies like Gravity. This doesn't mean that Google wants to get into the movie business, but hey, if a robot's good enough to make a movie, what else can it do?\nBoston",

The company is known for building all kinds of futuristic bots from the bipedal, humanoid robot Atlas (above) to the impossibly fast, four-legged Cheetah. Actually, Boston Dynamics brings a whole robot army to Google, one that the military is very eager to recruit.\nGoogle's latest purchase is less interested in building an actual robot than in designing an intelligent robot brain. The self-described \"cutting edge artificial intelligence company\" that uses \"the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms: comes with a team of 75 researchers and software engineers whose talents could be put to use on anything from the hypothetical Googlebot to the company's flagship search engine and anything in between. Because after all, robots are just another step in Google becoming the company that is everywhere, and does everything."

        "prompt": "The first of April is the day we remember what we are the other 364 days of the year.\nOn April 1, 2003, Abbas Khalaf Kunfuth, the Iraqi ambassador to Russia, stepped onto a podium in Moscow to address the international press. Most in the crowd expected to hear him concede defeat for his nation. After all, thousands of American-led coalition forces were sweeping through Iraq. Kunfuth held up what he said was a bulletin from Reuters news service.\n\"The Americans,\" he read, \"have accidentally fired a nuclear missile into British forces, killing seven.\"\nA stunned silence immediately overcame the room. Then Kunfuth shouted \"April Fool's!\"\nDespite a few such enormously inappropriate and maladroit examples, the prank played to salute the first day of April remains an honored tradition through most of the world.\nThe origins of April Fool's Day go back, some say, to 16th Century France, others say, further. In some accounts, the day of trickery is tied to a rite of spring, in others to the change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. In 1983, an Associated Press story attempted to set the record straight, quoting Joseph Boskin, a history professor at Boston University, who had researched the subject.\nHe said that the practice began during the reign of Roman emperor Constantine, when his court's jesters and fools claimed they could do a better job of running the empire. Constantine allowed a jester named Kugel to be king for a day. Kugel passed an edict calling for nothing but absurdity on that day, and the custom became an annual event. Shortly after the AP story ran, it came to light that Professor Boskin was a prankster and the explanation was just one more April Fool's Day prank.\nAlex Boese (pronounced burr-za), on the other hand, is a historian of hoaxes. He has collected scores of them in his 2002 book, \"Museum of Hoaxes,\" and his Web site www.museumofhoaxes.com. He has recently published \"Hippo Eats Dwarf: A Field Guide to Hoaxes and Other BS.\"\n\"When I was a grad student in history at the University of California San Diego,\" he said. \"I'd read references to hoaxes and pranks, track them down and make notes on them. Then I started going through microfilm for various newspapers looking at the April 1 editions going back into the 19th Century. You have to go through the whole week though, because the hoax isn't always identified as such right away.\"\nBoese's research turned up an announcement in the April 1, 1878, edition of the New York Graphic newspaper, that Thomas Edison had invented a machine able to transform soil directly into cereal and water directly into wine, thereby ending world hunger. Newspapers throughout America copied the article, heaping lavish praise on Edison.\nThe Buffalo Commercial Advertiser was particularly effusive in its praise, waxing eloquent about Edison's brilliance in a long editorial. A few days later, the Graphic reprinted the Advertiser's editorial in full, placing above it a simple, triumphant headline: \"They Bite!\"\nBoese said he thinks that prank worked because Edison had invented the phonograph just the year before, and the nation thought he was a miracle-worker. \"The trick to a really good prank,\" Boese said, \"is to have it be substantially absurd but believable to some gullible people.\"\nA case in point: In the April, 1998, issue of an online newsletter published by New Mexicans for Science and Reason there appeared an article claiming that the Alabama legislature had voted to change the value of pi from 3.14159 to the \"Biblical value\" of 3.0.\nAerospace engineers and others in the scientific community were quoted opposing the legislation then awaiting only the governor's signature. One, professor Kim Johanson, a mathematician from the University of Alabama, said that pi is a universal constant and cannot arbitrarily be changed. It has an infinite number of digits after the decimal point and can never be known exactly. The article also quoted the bill's sponsor, Leonard Lee Lawson (R-Crossville), who questioned the usefulness of any number that cannot be calculated exactly, and suggested that never knowing the exact answer could harm students' self-esteem.\n\"We need to return to some absolutes in our society,\" Lawson was said to have said.\n\"We just thought we'd have a little fun,\" said Dave Thomas, president of New Mexicans for Science and Reason, \"but our little joke got out of control.\"\nThrough the magic of the Internet, the piece flew around the globe, turning up in such exotic locals as a German chat room dedicated to singer Tori Amos. Thomas, who works for a company that makes test equipment for things like auto parts, tracked the flight on his computer. \"It was,\" he said, \"like being in the control room watching the virus spread in \"24.\"\nThe author of the piece was Mark Boslough, a physicist at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, whose not so nudge-nudge workday efforts include \"computational exploration of novel methods for asteroid defense.\" Boslough had intended his article as a satire on politicians attempting to curtail the teaching of evolution.\nThe article itself evolved as it spread across the World Wide Web. \"We had put in little clues that it was a hoax,\" Thomas said, \"like the wrong name for the governor of Alabama. At some point in the article's travels, that name got corrected.\"\nThe pi prank is No. 7 on the Museum of Hoaxes list of top April Fool's Day tricks.\nNo. 1 on the list is the \"documentary\" shown in 1957 on BBC television depicting the unusually abundant spaghetti harvest that year. The film aired on Panorama, a public affairs show for a high-brow audience -- the last place one would expect something so low-brow as an April Fool's Day stunt. Happy villagers in the area of Switzerland just across the Italian border were shown hand-picking the pasta from the \"orchards\" of trees (unlike, the show's highly respected anchor Richard Dimbleby noted, \"the vast spaghetti plantations in the Po Valley. For the Swiss, it tends to be more of a family affair.\"\nDimbleby's upper crust monotone delivery continued, \"Another reason why this may be a bumper year lies in the virtual disappearance of the spaghetti weevil, the tiny creature whose depradations have caused much concern in the past.\"\nThe film ends on a upbeat note: \"For those who love this dish, there's nothing like real, home-grown spaghetti.\"\nViewers called the network to inquire about growing their own spaghetti trees. The BBC's reported response was: \"place a sprig of spaghetti in a tin of tomato sauce and hope for the best.\"\nThe BBC has proven a rich source of April first pranks. In 1980, it reported that Big Ben, the clock that is iconic of London, was going digital. In 1999, BBC Radio announced that the national anthem (\"God Save the Queen\") was to be replaced by a Euro Anthem sung in German. The new anthem, played over the air, sampled various Beethoven works and was sung by pupils of a German school in London. Reportedly, Prince Charles' office telephoned to ask for a copy of the new anthem. St. James Palace later insisted that it had been playing along with the prank and had never been taken in by it.\nAmong the great hoaxes this side of the pond was one involving the very symbol of the founding of our nation. In 1996, the fast-food chain Taco Bell had full-page ads in seven major newspapers across the country declaring that the company had bought the Liberty Bell and was renaming it the Taco Liberty Bell.\n\"Couldn't do one like that today,\" said David Paine with a hint of regret in his voice. Paine, head of Paine PR, and some of his staff worked on the hoax with Taco Bell executives.\n\"There were four people in the library at Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine, Calif., sitting around a table drinking Pepsi (Taco Bell's corporate parent),\" Paine said. \"We were looking to tie into their new ad campaign of `Nothing ordinary about it,' the fact that it wasn't another burger store. We were trying to think symbolically and maybe a little irreverently, since Taco Bell had already started down that path.\n\"The idea to do some kind of April Fool's joke actually had come from John Martin's mother. He was Taco Bell's CEO. I don't know who actually said `Taco Liberty Bell,' but it was the most successful project I've been involved with,\" Paine said.\nSuccessful indeed. The campaign cost about $300,000. Free publicity surrounding",
        "baseline": " the story generated the equivalent of $25 million in advertising. Taco Bell sales increased by $500,000 on April 1 and $600,000 on April 2 over the prior week's same day sales.\nIs he tempted to pull another April surprise?\n\"You couldn't do that now,\" Paine said. \"It's a different climate. Also there was an online hoax that ended up reducing a company's stock. It was a scam for profit. Everyone got nervous after that.\"\nThese days, it isn't just the pranksters who need to proceed with caution on the first day of April.\nGoogle found that out on April 1, 2004, when it announced its new mail service, Gmail. Looking at the release date, people generally dismissed Gmail as a prank. The joke was on Google. It hadn't been kidding.\nMaybe they should have labeled the release, \"This is an actual press release, not an April Fool trick.\"\nThat would have done it."

        "prompt": "WASHINGTON — Homelessness is up for the second year in a row. That is no surprise to me. I spent the last few days in New York City, where it seems the homeless are as numerous as the tourists. They are everywhere. Not that they are not numerous in our nation’s capital, too. I returned to Washington by the train, and there are areas of Union Station that are as populated with homeless people as the nearby shelter. The scenes are appalling. What can be done?\nThe homeless have been one of the country’s vexed problems since the 1980s, when the left became concerned about them — all the more so to give the Reagan administration another social problem to be blamed for. But the truth is that the homeless have always been the left’s problem and the left’s clients. Homelessness occurs mainly in big cities, those glistening jewels of Democratic government.\nSome 25 percent of the homeless in America today live in just two cities, New York and Los Angeles. Read up on homelessness and within a few paragraphs, you will find yourselves confronted by statistics on the lack of affordable rental homes, or the lack of affordable homes, or the underfunding of our welfare programs — all to be provided by government. To which I would respond that we have spent over a trillion dollars on welfare since the 1960s when then-President Lyndon Johnson launched his War on Poverty, and we now have about as many people living under the poverty level as when we began. All that has changed is the amount of money going to the impoverished. Yet the majority of articles I have read on poverty complained that we do not do enough to keep people from becoming homeless.\nNew York City increased services to the homeless to $172 million this year, much of it on improved security and living conditions in the city shelters. Yet homelessness in New York increased by 2.8 percent, and, if recent history is to be our guide, it is going to increase by more next year. Then perhaps the Democrats will increase their spending by another $172 million, possibly by $200 million. That is the way homelessness spending has been going since the days when we used the terms “hobos” and “skid rows” to describe what was a minor urban problem. Now it is a major problem, and frankly, I do not think spending money on the homeless is the way to cope with the problem.\nHomelessness is caused by people living radically disorganized lives. The disorganization is caused by alcohol and drug addiction. It is caused by a multitude of pathologies that are never addressed by the social worker, or at least rarely",
        "baseline": " addressed. Ask a social worker, if you can find one who has the time to answer your question. Most are very busy and overworked on problems that are, for the most part, impossible to solve.\nIn the meantime, many of the same people who paved the way for homelessness are busy legalizing marijuana — and, who knows, maybe cocaine and heroin next. In other words, they are paving the way to make sure that radically disorganized lives become still more disorganized. Moreover, those who are intent on legalizing drugs are paving the way for still more people to participate in the misery of the homeless.\nThe path to the future is not well-lit, but one thing is clear: If urban government continues as it has since the days when the homeless replaced the “hobo” and “skid row,” the homeless population will only grow.\nR.

        "prompt": "Government agencies are seeking broad new authority to ramp up killings and removals of gray wolves in the Northern Rockies and Great Lakes, despite two recent court actions that restored the animal's endangered status in every state except Alaska and Minnesota.\nVarious proposals would gas pups in their dens, surgically sterilize adult wolves and allow \"conservation\" or \"research\" hunts to drive down the predators' numbers.\nOnce poisoned to near-extermination in the lower 48 states, wolves made a remarkable comeback over the last two decades under protection of the Endangered Species Act. But as packs continue to multiply their taste for livestock and big game herds coveted by hunters has stoked a rising backlash.\nWildlife officials say that without public wolf hunting, they need greater latitude to eliminate problem packs. Montana and Idaho held inaugural hunts last year but an August court ruling scuttled their plans for 2010.\n\"As the wolf populations increase, the depredations increase and the number of wolf removals will increase. It's very logical,\" said Mark Collinge, Idaho director for Wildlife Services, the U.S. Department of Agriculture branch that removes problem wolves, typically by shooting them from aircraft.\n\"You just have to accept that part of having wolves is having to kill wolves,\" he said.\nBut wildlife advocates and animal rights groups contend the response to depredating wolves has become too heavy-handed. They say a string of court decisions in their favor underscores that the species remains at risk.\n\"The draconian lengths they are poised to take really are a throwback, to when the same agency was gassing wolf pups in their dens almost a century ago and setting poisoned baits and trapping them,\" said Michael Robinson with the Center for Biological Diversity.\nAt least 1,700 wolves now roam Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. There are more than 4,000 in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. New populations are taking hold in Oregon and Washington, and wolves have been sighted in Colorado, Utah and New England.\nSome of the most remote wilderness habitats are becoming saturated with the animals. As a result, packs are pushing into agricultural and residential areas where domestic animals offer an easy meal.\nOne of the more extreme proposals -- burying wolf pups in their dens and then poisoning them with carbon monoxide gas -- would be used only infrequently, in cases where the rest of the pack had been killed for preying on livestock, officials said.\nMore established practices, including shooting wolves from the air and ground, would be expanded.\nIn Montana and Idaho, officials hope to revive hunting seasons by rebranding them as \"conservation hunts\" or \"research hunts.\" Also, Montana Democrat U.S. Senator Max Baucus wants ranchers to have more freedom to shoot wolves harassing livestock.\nA novel, non-lethal approach to wolf control is being considered in Idaho, according to a Department of Agriculture proposal. After being surgically sterilized, pairs of wolves would be radio-collared and released -- \"to maintain and defend their territory against other wolf packs that might be more likely to prey on livestock.\"\nKilling marauding wolves is nothing new in some parts of their range: In the Northern Rockies, more than 1,400 have been killed by wildlife agents and ranchers since the first 66 wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho in the mid-1990s.\nBut Wisconsin and Michigan in the past avoided wolf killings, instead relocating plundering animals or taking defensive measures such as fencing in livestock. Under applications pending with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the states want new authority to remove up to 10 percent of their wolves annually, equal to about 110 wolves a year.\nGovernment statistics back up critics' claims that wolves account for a small proportion of livestock losses caused by predators. They kill fewer sheep and cattle than coyotes, bears, mountain lions or even dogs.\nYet where packs get onto ranchlands, the results can be brutal for both wolves and livestock. That was illustrated in a string of recent cattle killings and reprisals outside the small town of Ennis, Mont.\nSince late July, at least six ranches near Ennis have suffered cattle killings by a wolf group known as the Horse Creek pack, which lives at the base of the Gravelly mountains.\nWithin two weeks of the first calf being killed, wolf specialists with Wildlife Services killed two adult members of the Horse Creek pack in hopes of deterring the others.\nOne was shot on July 29 and the second on Aug. 6 -- just a day after U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy in Missoula, Mont. ordered the region's wolves back onto the endangered species list.",
        "baseline": "\nAfter the attacks continued and several more calves died, state officials on Aug. 12 ordered the entire pack removed. Another calf was found dead on Aug. 13, and two on Aug. 17.\nTwo more Horse Creek wolves were shot.\nOn Aug. 18, three more calves turned up dead, bringing the total dead livestock to at least a dozen.\n\"When we authorize it, we're confident they're going to get it done,\" she said.\nRancher Jerry Dickinson said the Horse Creek pack killed at least three calves worth a combined $2,400 on the Granger ranch, which he manages.\nTheir carcasses were found on the Beaverhead National Forest, where the calves had been grazing. Others have disappeared without a trace.\n\"If they take that pack out, we've bought ourselves maybe two or three years until another pack establishes itself,\" Dickinson said. \"Eventually another bunch of wolves will move in there and we'll get the same problem all over.\""

She committed to sharing the outcome of this process.\nHowever that Report has not yet been released to the public.\nWe firmly believe that there is an overriding public interest in the release of any report and getting to the centre of this",

Transparency must be the order of the day.\nIf we are to ensure true democracy, responsible parties must be held accountable and the playing field must be levelled, to ensure fair elections in the future.\nAt the bedrock, this is not about the OBA.

        "prompt": "Why Is The U.N. In The War-Making Business?\nThe strangest aspect of the United Nations' \"no-fly zone\" war over Libya is the involvement of the United Nations itself. While Congress' approval was all but an afterthought, the Obama administration devoted intense diplomatic energy to winning the approval of the United Nation's Security Council. No one asked: Why the U.N. is in the business of approving military actions at all?\nThe United Nations, created to end wars, now prolongs and enlarges them. It is time to take a hard look at the U.N.'s war-ending, peace-making record. After all, the promotion of peace is supposed to be its main duty.\nIn the wake of World War II, political leaders looked out on a devastated world. They saw in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and the Americas new graveyards spring up filled with millions of young men. In the richest parts of Europe and Asia there were bombed and burnt cities. Fearing that another global war would spell the end of civilization, they built a global institution that was supposed to stop small wars from getting big and end big wars altogether.\nThe U.N. bureaucracy lost its way. The U.N. has sanctioned two wars against Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and now has approved the aerial bombardment of Libya.\nWhatever the merits of these wars, they are wars. And the U.N. approved them, as opposed to stopping them. It has morphed from a war-ending mission to a war-sanctioning vote. Of course there already are legislative bodies to declare wars: the U.S. Congress and the parliaments of various nations.\nDuplication aside, there are good reasons that the U.N. should not be in the war-approving business.\nDeclaring war is an intimate act between a people and government, a solemn decision that weighs the lives and fortunes of its citizens against the state's interest in securing the safety and trade of its citizens. In any democracy, this balancing act produces a lively debate. Most U.N. representatives represent nothing more than the ruling cliques, which are unelected or elected dishonestly. The people who are going to pay for or fight in these U.N. approved wars have no way to hold U.N. representatives accountable and too many of the war-making discussions at the U.N. are held in secret.\nMore insidiously, the U.N. fuels and funds the small conflicts it is supposed to end. Its scandalous administration of the \"oil for food\" program extended a lifeline to Saddam Hussein, perpetuating his power and the dangerous instability he represented, while corrupting scores of officials at the U.N. and in governments around the world.\nOr consider the case of the world's longest-running and most pointless war between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front, a ragtag group of rebels residing in an Algerian slice of the Sahara. The war has raged, on and off, since 1975--with the U.N.'s acquiescence.\nThe U.N. created a body called MINURSO that has utterly failed to end conflict or resettle the some 200,000 refugees now eking out a spare existence in a scattering of mud-brick hovels without running water or continuous electricity. I visited the rebels' refugee camps in 2010 near Tindouf, Algeria. The people call themselves the Sahrawi and they yearn to return to their homeland in southern Morocco.\nWhile tens of thousands of them disappear into the desert every year and often reappear in the newly prosperous southern reaches of Morocco--where the king and his government have spent more than $15 billion since 1975 to build roads, hospitals, airports and apartment buildings--many more are trapped in the Polisario refugee camps either afraid to make the dangerous trek or afraid of retribution from the Polisario if they try. Those that don't run to Morocco, run into the arms of al Qaeda's North African offshoot.\nSome attend al Qaeda's paramilitary training camps and serve in the growing army of al Qaeda in the Magreb (AQIM). The group specializes in taking European tourists hostage and carrying out attacks on army and police forces across North Africa. Other Sahrawis act as desert guides for AQIM or operate supply depots for it. As AQIM becomes bigger and stronger, it could pose a real threat to American interests in the region.\nThe Sahrawi's have good reason to run. There are no jobs in the camp and food is scarce. Young men cannot marry because they cannot afford to pay a traditional dowry. And the camps are essentially a one-party dictatorship. The Polisario claims to represent the Sahrawi people, but its elections are East German-style single-candidate rubber stamps. Thousands have fled the rebel refugee camps for a better life in Morocco.\nIn short, the Polisario is holding the Sahrawi hostage in the hopes of bargaining themselves into running a country they can rule while the camps become havens for al Qaeda affiliated terrorists and drug smugglers. As the situation worsens, the U.N. holds more meetings.\nYet the U.N. has leverage. The rebels survive on aid from the United Nations, grants from local European governments (mostly Spanish regional bodies run by leftists who feel guilty about Spain's colonial post in Southern Morocco) and by facilitating illegal trade in guns, drugs and women. In the past, the Polisario's leaders have been covertly aiding Al Qaeda's North African affiliate and depositing their loot in European banks. If the U.N. leaned on European governments to close the Polisario's bank accounts and cut its aid, the Polisario would be more likely to accept the King of Morocco's offer of amnesty and re-settlement of the refugees in their now prosperous homelands.\nWhile the rebels are unable to win on the battlefield--Morocco built a 2,000-km wall of sand sensors and military bases to block cross-border raids--the Polisario fights on with endless motions before various U.N. bodies.\nIndeed",
        "baseline": ", the U.N. (and the media) are its primary battlefields. And without the U.N., there would be no war.\nMeanwhile, the U.N. maintains a special envoy who is conducting yet another summit conference in New York.\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon came in pledging to reform the institution. He could begin by closing down MINURSO and the Special Envoy's office. Without the U.N., the parties would have every incentive to settle their differences. Without the U.N., there would be peace.\nThat is quite an indictment of the world's biggest peace-making body.\nRichard Miniter is an investigative journalist and bestselling author whose work has appeared in the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Atlantic Monthly, Reader's Digest, New Republic and National Review.

        "prompt": "The Land of Lincoln was the focus of a river cruise on the American Duchess paddle-wheeler that traversed almost the entire length of the Illinois River in August.\nThe Illinois River isn’t exactly top of mind when it comes to recreational river cruises, a pursuit that conjures up far-flung locations like the Danube, Nile and Amazon. But the nearly 275-mile-long waterway that threads through the heart of the Prairie State served as the main setting for a groundbreaking — make that waterbreaking? — cruise this past summer. That’s when the 166-passenger American Duchess paddle-wheeler made its way from the Mississippi River town of Alton, up to Ottawa, on the Illinois.\nI witnessed that excitement firsthand in August on the ship’s inaugural trip along the Illinois River, a route typically populated by commercial barges and smaller pleasure boats. Tagging along was my 13-year-old niece, Sara, a good half-century younger than most of the passengers.\nDuring our deep dive into the Land of Lincoln, the year-old Duchess made maiden calls at several ports, including Peoria, whose riverfront bustled with a Saturday morning farmers market, and the sleepier town of Havana, where the mayor, a Dixieland jazz band and camera-toting residents turned out to greet the Victorian-style vessel as she cozied up to shore.\nIn these parts, the Duchess was a bona fide aquatic anomaly. The limited-but-growing inventory of overnight cruise boats plying U.S. rivers tends to cluster on bigger, better-known waterways. And many of these ships simply aren’t a good fit for the Illinois River, a tributary of the Mississippi that basically flows southwest of Joliet, at the confluence of the Kankakee and Des Plaines rivers, all the way down to Grafton, not too far north of St. Louis. The vessels are often too tall to navigate the northern reaches of the Illinois; in the game of limbo between the boat and some of the low-slung bridges that straddle the water, the boat loses.\nEven the relatively compact Duchess had to collapse its black smokestacks and sun-deck umbrellas to squeeze under spans carrying trains and trucks roaring overhead. If heavy rain had caused water levels to rise too much, that would have been the end of our river road.\nCruise companies are willing to tackle these kinds of logistical headaches if it means giving the growing riverboat market new and off-the-beaten-path itineraries like this one, dubbed “Lincoln’s Illinois.” By venturing deeper into domestic waterways, they’re catering to a clientele that craves the intimacy of riverboat cruising but doesn’t necessarily want to fly to a foreign country to experience it. They’re targeting folks who are eager for longer, overnight journeys on U.S. rivers but have already “done” the Mississippi or the Columbia and Snake rivers in the Pacific Northwest.\nJust about everyone I talked to aboard the Duchess — one of three paddle-wheelers owned by American Queen Steamboat Co., which has a fourth on the way — had previously traveled with the New Albany, Ind.-based riverboat cruise line. They’d usually cruised some stretch of the Mississippi — the Memphis-New Orleans leg is especially popular — and they’d usually done it on the company’s largest vessel, the 436-passenger American Queen.\nHere’s something different: seeing Abraham Lincoln in a bright orange life jacket during the ship’s mandatory muster drill.\nAbraham Lincoln, played by Freeport resident George Buss, waves as the boat pulls away from Hannibal, Mo.\nThe country’s esteemed POTUS, played with haunting perfection by Freeport resident and Lincoln impersonator George Buss, traveled onboard with us for most of the voyage. He and Mary Todd (Buss’ actual wife) would pop up in various spots around the boat, making small talk with passengers and delivering snack-sized doses of history in keeping with the trip’s Lincoln theme. When we ran into Honest Abe one sunny afternoon on the top deck, he pulled out a copy of the Gettysburg Address from his stovepipe hat and gave it to my niece.\nIt was a little head-trippy to think that nearly two centuries ago, the real Lincoln worked on this very waterway, piloting a flatboat full of supplies headed for New Orleans.\nThe towns that bookended our cruise hosted the first and last of the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858, a series of verbal smackdowns that started in Ottawa and ended a few months later in Alton.\nNot surprisingly, the cruise’s shore excursions often featured a tie-in to the 16th president, whether it be one of the stops on the ship’s private hop-on, hop-off buses that take passengers on a continuous sightseeing circuit in every port, or something more elaborate, like the “premium excursion” (read: extra cost) that shuttled us from Havana to Springfield for the day. On that one, we logged a lot of Lincoln: a visit to his presidential museum, a tour of the only home he ever owned, a stop at his tomb and a trip to nearby New Salem, a re-creation of the village where Lincoln lived in the 1830s.\n“It’s like a field trip!” Sara said on our motor coach ride to the state capital.\nSara, about to enter eighth grade, was the only kid on the cruise. Heck, at 49 years old, even I felt like a kid. The average age of American Queen Steamboat Co. passengers is about 72, according to company officials. Shave a decade off that for customers on its American Empress boat based in the Pacific Northwest.\n“This is how old people have fun,” an energetic septuagenarian stage-whispered to my niece as her smiling husband grabbed her hand and led her onto the ship’s dance floor. The band jammed out show tunes and other well-known hits while the enthusiastic crowd clapped along.\nShe didn’t have a ship’s kids club to retreat to, or other tweens and teens to play with. But plenty of passengers stepped up to fill the social void, taking on the role of de facto grandparents, showering her with warm smiles and conversation.\nA retired Florida couple even invited us to a pre-dinner cocktail party in their swanky loft suite, a 550-square-foot, two-story space with a private balcony — roughly three times the size of our interior stateroom.\nThe butler doted on Sara, making sure her wine glass was full of Sprite.\n“Old people are nice,” Sara later declared.\nHigh ceilings and soaring windows in the Duchess' dining room give passengers a good view of the outdoors.\nWe both relished the semiformal fun of our nightly ritual: eating a multicourse meal in the Duchess’ elegant, high-ceilinged dining room. The expansive windows were like a movie screen, showing an endless loop of scenery as diners dug into filet mignon, grilled salmon, fettuccine Alfredo, lobster tails, etc.\nUnlike on some cruises, Duchess passengers don’t have to eat at the same time, same table. We could show up whenever we wanted between 5:30 and 8 p.m., either opting for a table for two or, if we were feeling more social, joining others who felt the same.\nFor our post-show dessert, we’d swing by the boat’s self-service Perks cafe to rustle up an ice cream sundae we’d eat on the top deck, under the stars.\nThe 340-foot-long Duchess isn’t big by cruise-ship standards, but it’s outfitted with a lot of the amenities you’d expect in larger vessels: a show lounge, a fitness center, multiple venues to eat and drink.\nOne thing it doesn’t have is a casino, which is kind of ironic given the boat’s origin. The hull used to belong to the Isle of Capri riverboat casino, a longtime fixture in the Quad Cities. American Queen Steamboat Co. bought it in 2016, transforming it into a boutique riverboat reminiscent of a white wedding cake. The old-fashioned gingerbread trim on the outside belies a more modern interior with contemporary furniture and art.\nA daily newsletter was dropped off in our cabin each night, per cruise ship protocol. The “River Times” detailed the next day’s port and a schedule of onboard activities, so you’d know when to catch a game of bingo or trivia in the Lincoln Library or an educational talk by the so-called Riverlorian, the ship’s resident culture and history expert.\nDespite its relatively snug size, the Duchess never felt crowded. While most passengers gravitated to the rocking chairs on the second and third decks or loitered over coffee at the River Club Terrace at the back of the boat, Sara and I preferred camping out on the couches on the top of the ship’s sprawling sun deck — a place we had virtually to ourselves. We used the boat’s binoculars to spot bald eagles and watch startled Asian carp shoot out of the water as motorboats zoomed by.\nAt port, getting on and off the ship was quick and easy. We were usually met with some kind of surprise as we disembarked.\nIn the small town of Grafton, the surprise was a delicious one: crates full of free, perfectly ripe peaches plucked in Calhoun County.\nA Grafton alderman joined us on one of the ship’s hop-on, hop-off buses, filling us in on the history of the town, a place hit particularly hard by the devastating floods of 1993.\nGrafton sits at the mouth of the Illinois River, where it empties into the Mississippi. It was bumpin’ back in the steamboat era. The port once teemed with passengers headed to St. Louis or St. Paul on the Mississippi or making their way to Peoria on the Illinois. The fishing and boat-building industries were booming.\nThese days, fewer than 700 people call Grafton home. The harbor has reinvented itself as the “Key West to the Midwest,” a summer playground for boaters and bar-hoppers.\n“You wouldn’t believe how many people pour in on the weekends,” the alderman said.\nOn our Tuesday morning visit, Grafton wasn’t in party mode. Sara and I strolled along the quiet main drag, ducking into a few artsy boutiques and antique shops.\nWe decided to hop back on the hop-on bus for a ride to Illinois’ largest state park: Pere Marquette. Measuring more than 8,000 acres, the park has one of those imposing limestone and timber lodges built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Depression. We only had time for a short but worthwhile hike up to one of Pere Marquette’s many Native American burial mounds before it was anchors aweigh.\nWe had more time to explore at the only non-Illinois port of the cruise: Mark Twain’s hometown of Hannibal, Mo., a stop that entailed gliding along the Mississippi River before backtracking to the base of the Illinois.\nIn Hannibal, the surprise waiting for us at the dock was a young boy and girl dressed as Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher, foreshadowing a day that would be chock-full of Mark Twain.\nSara and I borrowed a couple of the ship’s bikes — a nice amenity — and pedaled to the nearby Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum.\nWe hoofed it up a bunch of stairs to the Mark Twain Memorial Lighthouse.\nWe ate fried chicken and homemade root beer at the Mark Twain Dinette and poked our heads in the riverfront brewery named — wait for it — Mark Twain Brewing Co.\nThe hop-on, hop-off bus took us to the Mark Twain Cave, a chilly labyrinth featured in several of the author’s books.\n“Aren’t you glad I made you read ‘Huck Finn’ and ‘Tom Sawyer’ before the trip?” I asked in Wise Aunt voice.\nNow it was Sara’s turn to be appalled.\nMigrating American white pelicans crowd a green swath of land on the Illinois River north of Peoria.\nThe Mississippi River stretch of the journey is where our boat passed through the most locks. Going through locks, much like squeezing under low bridges, adds a jolt of excitement to river travel.\nWhen we pulled up to these engineering feats, passengers lined the deck’s rails as the Duchess oh-so-gently maneuvered into its cement chute. A gate closed behind us, allowing the water level to rise or fall as needed before another barrier opened, sending us on our way.\nWe took these “water stairs” nine times over the course of the cruise, a voyage that led us past steep limestone bluffs and forests of leafy trees that made me wish it were autumn, not August. Peaceful. Tranquil. That’s how I can best describe the sensation of sitting on the sun deck, cruising at a leisurely 5 to 6 mph, with a soundtrack supplied by chirping cicadas and the gentle hum of the engine.\nI liked watching the wildlife, wondering if that heron hopscotching alongside us was being curious or territorial, trying to run our giant wedding cake out of town.\nIt felt like a mashup of Ireland and the Everglades as we passed an emerald green island full of migrating American white pelicans.\nAround the bend, a couple of fawns ventured to the water’s edge before darting back into the brush.\nA rainbow shimmered in the blue sky as we pulled out of Havana.\nNear the end of our journey, we cruised by Starved Rock State Park, getting a stellar view of its namesake sandstone butte.\nThat’s the scenic highlight reel, mind you. During seven days on the water, we meandered through some mundane stretches too. Nature’s splendor was often interrupted by manmade inventions designed to quarry limestone, store grain and transport goods from Point A to Point B. Yet from the water, even these prosaic fixtures exuded a certain heartland charm.\nThe Illinois River will never be flanked by the grand cathedrals and castles of Europe, the pyramids of Egypt or the rainforests of the Amazon. But a row of towering silos at sunset has a homespun beauty of its own, at least to this Midwestern girl.\nAMERICAN QUEEN STEAMBOAT CO.: The riverboat cruise line has a trio of paddle-wheelers offering a range of overnight cruises on U.S. rivers.

You know the times where the Friends pretended to fall asleep when one of them — usually Ross — was telling a boring story? This was actually incorporated into the scripts because the actors did to each other in real life.\nPaget Brewster, who played Joey and then Chandler's girlfriend Kathy, revealed that the cast would always make fun of each other. She said: \"If someone made a joke and it didn’t work, they’d all turn on the person and be like: 'You blew it, Lisa!' They would bust each other’s balls. And they started adding this thing into the script that they did to each other in real life: one of them would be talking, and they’d all pretend to fall asleep.\"\n5.

        "prompt": "A recent study investigated the levels of specific DNA fragments in the blood of ovarian cancer patients. The findings could eventually lead to a blood test that can make accurate predictions about tumor size and disease progression.\nDetecting DNA fragments from tumors could provide a useful tool in the treatment of cancer.\nOvarian cancer affects around 20,000 women in the United States each year. It is the ninth most common cancer in the U.S., but the fifth leading cause of cancer death.\nThe earlier ovarian cancer is caught, the more likely treatment is to be successful.\nHigh-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most malignant form of ovarian cancer, accounting for 70 percent of cases.\nCurrently, as with most other cancers, assessing how well a treatment is performing is difficult. In a perfect world, if doctors had full visibility of how a tumor was responding to a certain medication, they would be able to manipulate the drug type and schedule with more confidence.\nTreatment and progression of HGSOC are gauged by measuring levels of a protein called CA-125. However, after one or two treatment cycles, the levels do not change quickly enough. This makes results difficult to interpret. Also, CA-125 can be expressed by normal tissue, making false readings a further concern.\nResearchers from Cancer Research UK's Cambridge Institute recently set out to investigate another molecule that might act as a more responsive marker. A team of scientists, led by Nitzan Rosenfeld and James Brenton, published their findings this week in PLOS Medicine.\nThe molecule in question is circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). These short sections of genetic code are released from tumor cells as they die. They enter circulation and can be picked up in the bloodstream.\nCtDNA has been studied for more than 20 years, but making use of it as a diagnostic tool has not been easy - tiny portions of ctDNA must be identified within a sea of normal circulating DNA fragments.\nThanks to recent advances in the sensitivity of assaying technology, ctDNA has become a potentially useful tool for assessing cancer progression. However, while there have been a number of intriguing studies suggesting ctDNA's potential use in tracking cancer, research is still in its infancy.\nTo investigate these fragments further, Rosenfeld and Brenton concentrated specifically on levels of ctDNA that carried mutations in the gene TP53. These mutations can be found in 99 percent of patients with HGSOC.\nThe team took 318 blood samples from 40 HGSOC patients before, during, and after treatment. Alongside these analyses, computerized tomography (CT) scans of tumors and information on the progression of the cancer were also noted.\nThe team found that levels of mutated TP53 in ctDNA (TP53MAF) correlated with the volume of the tumor (when compared with the CT scan), and also the patient's time to progression.\nWhen compared with the diagnostic abilities of CA-125, TP53MAF fared much better. CA-125 took 84 days to reflect changes following chemotherapy. TP53MAF, on the other hand, took just 37 days.\nIn patients being treated for a relapse, a decrease of 60 percent or less in TP53MAF was associated with a weaker response to chemotherapy and a time to progression of under 6 months. A decrease in levels of more than 60 percent was associated with a longer time to progression.\nIn simple terms, a greater drop in the amount of tumor DNA found in the blood correlates with improved patient outcomes.\n\"These findings have strong potential for clinical utility owing to the ease of assaying DNA in plasma and the low cost and speed of ctDNA testing. Having very early information on response would empower patients and physicians to test alternative treatment options and have high utility in trials that link biomarkers to targeted therapy.\"\nThe researchers are quick to mention the study's shortfalls.

We don’t want to have huge stinking trash heaps of coagulated waste stinking to high heaven near our homes, work, or places of entertainment. That is why we are trying to limit pollution across the map such as reducing carbon omissions, reusing items as life hacks, and recycling whenever we can.\nDespite our good intentions, we are not perfect beings and there will be times when the easiest option for waste is just to throw it away. Also, the world doesn’t seem to share our sympathetic views of keeping our planet clean, especially when it comes to plastic. In fact, most of our trash is thrown away into one place: the ocean. As a result, every ocean now has a giant swirling vortex of plastic garbage.\nAccording to an article by Vox, a single conservative estimate suggests that at least 1 million tons of plastic has entered the ocean since the 1970s. Taking our knowledge of underwater currents, scientists were able to find the swirling vortexes of plastic. Each vortex is also calculated to have thousands of tons of plastic in the underwater current cyclone. Here is the kicker: We reported that at least 1 million tons of plastic has entered the ocean, so where did the rest go? The vortexes only account for less than 1 percent of the plastic in estimation. Therefore, nobody really knows where the other 99 percent went. One weird possibility is that the fish are eating the plastic and it is entering the food chain.\nNevertheless, the garbage in our waters has increased in such high amounts that we now have something known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. It is a patch of trash the size of Texas that’s accumulated in a swirling subtropical underwater whirlpool",

To the human eye, or even from space, these garbage patches are invisible. Most of the plastic is bobbing just beneath the surface and most of the particles are smaller than one centimeter in diameter. Over time, plastic breaks down into smaller pieces, which is plausible in an ocean with currents, waves, and degradation from the sun.\nRight now, the scientists behind the findings are figuring out where the 99 percent of mixing plastic is. They have ideas, such as washing back on shore, or plastic being broken down even smaller than a centimeter in diameter, but right now, it is all theory."

We need to intervene much earlier if we want to make a big difference to the way peoples' lives turn out.\"\nPoulton said there was \"no magic bullet\" in life but if one wanted to identify priorities, increasing people's self control starting in early life would be a good candidate.\nThis seemed to be even more important than socioeconomic status and IQ for how life turned out.\n\"Self control is a skill, like sport, art or music, and it must be practised,\" he said.\n\"We've shown quite powerfully how important it is in just about every domain you can think of, from how you relate to others to whether you will become a career criminal.\"\nThe team mainly focused on social benefits but the researchers were aware that everything they studied had an economic component.\nIn the past five years, the researchers had pulled in almost $20 million in overseas grants and expected international funding support to continue.\n\"Bringing in significant overseas dollars tells us that the science we are doing is the best in the world,\" Poulton said.\n\"The United States can do lots of things. They can put people on the moon, send things to Mars but they haven't managed to create a study like ours because our treasure trove of data is unique.\"\nThe prizemoney will be used to buy sophisticated, high-tech equipment to help improve the team's comprehensive, gold-standard research and for new investigations.\nThese include musculoskeletal examinations, a focus on chronic kidney injury and measuring hearing and sight, as these are considered high burden problems this century.\nThe next assessment of study members was due to kick off next month and incorporated brain imaging to help understand how early-life adversity predicted adult behaviour.\n\"Winning the prize is not just for me.

Here’s betting that even April 16 will be here seemingly tomorrow.\nThose are the 45-day, 60-day and 120-day deadlines folded into the Open Government Directive, issued by the White House last month. The first, which arrives soon, is when every federal agency must identify and publish online at least three high-value datasets it plans to make available to the public.\nFifteen days after that, each agency must launch an open-government Web page that is ready to be updated in a timely fashion. By April 16, each agency must unveil an open-government plan that will describe how it will improve transparency and integrate public participation and collaboration into its activities.\nThose are tall orders in short times, to be sure. However, most agencies haven't devised an open-government plan, decided what data is high value or figured out how to share it with the public. The directive is a sweeping mandate designed to transform the way the federal government interacts with the public, yet even its White House authors say each agency is essentially moving through this territory on its own without a road map.\nAgencies have few choices for figuring out how to comply with the directive. They can go it alone and create a plan that they hope makes the grade. Perhaps some will join forces or find industry partners that might guide them to a successful outcome. Or, counting on the kindness of strangers in the White House, they can rely on promised support from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, where the authors of the directive live.\nBut even though the vagueness of the directive is a challenge, most agencies agree that it could be worse. Flexibility is better than getting strict and possibly draconian requirements that don’t account for agencies' special needs and different missions. For example, the way NASA shares images of the surface of Mars needs to be different than the way the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shares airline flight delay data.\nThe two men behind the directive are federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra and Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra.

After all, the memo issued by President Barack Obama that got all this whole thing rolling called for the directive to be published by late May 2009.

But Trump’s inaugural committee only spent about half of that money. The rest, it said, would go to philanthropic ends.\nMore than a year later, no one knows what those ends will be.\nA spokesperson for Tom Barrack, Trump’s personal friend and the chairman of the committee, told The Daily Beast on Dec. 8 that it would be filing an annual report detailing its charitable giving with the Internal Revenue Service “in the next several weeks.” It is now Feb. 12, and it still hasn’t done so and there is no indication of when it will.\nThe Trump Organization — the president’s global real estate and branding business — pledged not to keep any profits that it made by renting hotel rooms and banquet halls to foreign governments.

In January 2016, for instance, Trump said he had donated $1 million of his own money — and raised an additional $5 million from others — for veterans’ charities. But Trump did not make good on his $1 million promise until four months later, under pressure from the media. Before he actually paid, Trump’s campaign manager made a false claim that the money had already been spent.\nDuring last year’s presidential campaign, The Post also showed that Trump had spent years promising large donations to charity — building a public reputation as a man whose generosity was as impressive as his wealth.\nBut The Post found little evidence to show Trump’s actual generosity matched his boasting.\nThe Post called 450 charities that seemed close to the candidate — nonprofit groups that he had praised on Twitter or that had paid him to rent banquet space.

But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he’s met with every NFL team on an informal basis. He had “nine or 10” formal meetings set up for Friday night, but didn’t divulge which teams he’d be sitting down with.\nThere is clear interest in Butler, who declared for the draft after his junior season in which he had 60 receptions for 1,318 yards and nine touchdowns.\nBut in his mind, the hype machine hasn’t been turned up high enough — yet.\nButler, of course, is talking about Saturday�",

And he feels well-prepared because he’s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson. But for now, his goal is to prove what he already believes is true: that he is the top receiver in this draft."

        "prompt": "OTTAWA—The media’s ability to shield their sources, notes and reporting materials from police “fishing expeditions” could be strengthened after a senior federal Crown attorney made several concessions in a high-profile media case Wednesday at the Supreme Court of Canada.\nVice Media is fighting the RCMP’s effort to seize reporter Ben Makuch’s 2014 texts and communications with Farah Shirdon, a self-declared Canadian ISIS fighter.\nAlthough Shirdon is reported to be dead, the Crown and the RCMP have not given up the pursuit of Vice Media materials, and federal lawyer Croft Michaelson hammered the fact Shirdon could still be alive, could still return to Canada, and the public interest in prosecuting him remains high.\nHe urged the Supreme Court judges not to grant journalists any greater privacy protection against police searches than the state grants anyone involved in a criminal investigation.\n“The newsroom should not be entitled to any more protection than that most sensitive part of human society, the bedroom,” he said.\nHowever Michaelson conceded the common law could be “tweaked” to underline the importance of a journalist’s right to privacy and the right to free expression in a democratic society, and to set out clearer instructions for judges reviewing seizure orders.\nIt was a significant move that sets the stage for the Supreme Court of Canada under its new chief justice, Richard Wagner, and an almost entirely re-cast judicial bench to revisit earlier decisions, and Vice Media’s lawyer Phil Tunley was quick to invite the court to do so.\nTunley called the RCMP’s application for a production order against Vice a “fishing expedition,” saying the chances of prosecution are remote. Makuch, the reporter who communicated with Shirdon over a Kik text messaging app and wrote three articles in 2014 on the Canadian, agreed and went further. He believes Shirdon is dead, and the RCMP is simply trying to expand its reach in a digital age.\nThe case drew a slew of black-robed lawyers for various media organizations who were supportive intervenors. Tunley argued that even a new federal law that requires prior notice to media of police applications for production orders, and sets out other protections for “confidential” sources, doesn’t go far enough because it doesn’t protect communications with “non-confidential” sources.\nVice says Shirdon never asked for nor was granted confidentiality or anonymity by its reporter, and that the reporter’s work materials should remain off limits to the police.\nMichaelson said Canada already has a robust legal framework that sets out a case-by-case analysis which requires courts to weigh the public interest in investigation and prosecution of criminal offences against the public interest in a vibrant free press.\nHowever, several judges challenged whether that was enough or whether additional steps — like advance notice to the media in the first instance when police seek a warrant; or when an appeal judge reviews a warrant or production order — are required to really protect the right.\nJustices Rosalie Abella and Brown asked Michaelson what exactly he believes the Charter protects. He replied the constitutional freedom of expression guarantee expressly protects “freedom of the press” including a right to gather and disseminate information. He conceded that certain protections should be extended not just to “confidential” sources but also to the private, “off the record” or “not for attribution” communications between reporters and their sources who agree to be named.\nMichaelson, a senior Crown attorney who has long prosecuted high-profile criminal and terrorism cases, admitted he occasionally speaks to reporters but only on condition his remarks not be attributed.\nHe suggested the Supreme Court of Canada might want to “tweak the test” in the common law to capture the public interest in freedom of expression, even as he argued it is already recognized.\nAbella pressed Michaelson whether it would be “helpful” if the court outlined specific considerations for appeal courts to use when reviewing a lower court order, rather than sticking to what the current “deferential” model of review that leans toward upholding the authorizing judge’s take.\n“",
        "baseline": "Why not?” said Michaelson. “I mean other courts have, so if you’re inclined to do so, why not to make it clearer” that the standard of review in cases where journalists’s rights are involved “is a modified standard that must reflect” the principles he said the high court has already recognized.\nLawyer Paul Schabas representing a dozen international media organizations called on the Supreme Court to set out a new, clearer test in law as other countries have.\nAnother media lawyer, Justin Safayeni said on top of concerns about a “chilling effect” on sources, or self-censorship by reporters, there could be a real impact on public confidence in the impartiality and independence of the media if reporters are turned into an investigative arm of the police. He argued all of a journalists’ “work product” — notes, source contact lists, and recordings of interviews — should be protected."

        "prompt": "The world that Shooter Jennings has created in his ambitious new album, \"Black Ribbons,\" is more ominous than brave and more nerve-rackingly familiar than new in presenting a scenario of the dark days ahead for humankind in the tradition of Aldous Huxley's classic 1932 novel.\nYet the singer and songwriter, the maverick offspring of country music outlaws Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter, is putting his message across in myriad ways that Huxley wouldn't even have imagined in his treatise about a technological society in which there's little room for human connection.\nIt's an intriguing project -- one with a major guest role for horrormeister Stephen King as the acerbic narrator of a fanciful tale about the erosion of individual freedoms in the Internet Age. Jennings has made it by fully embracing the new avenues of expression the Internet has created.\nFor Jennings, who spent the last decade pushing at the boundaries of contemporary country music, it constitutes a dramatic departure from his country roots that finds him turning his back on the Nashville music establishment much like his father did three decades before him.\n\"When I started doing this record, I was in a place where I had left my label, left my management I had down there in Nashville, and felt like I was at rock bottom,\" Jennings, 30, said in the studio of the hilltop home above West Hollywood he shares with his fiancée, actress Drea De Matteo, and their 2-year-old daughter, Alabama. \"I was feeling pretty voiceless, and depressed. . . . At this point I'm thinking no one's going to buy my records anyway, and I just wanted to do something that was really fun and different and exciting.\"\n\"Black Ribbons\" was born, inspired during a cross-country RV trip with his family.\n\"I was driving the whole way,\" he said. \"We were in the middle of nowhere, and every night about midnight I'd hear these programs: everything that was on coast-to-coast stations to local radio -- whatever we could get on the AM dial we had. It was all this really scary talk about the ballooning police state, the globalization agendas and whatnot.\n\"Here I was with my family in the middle of America in this RV, and it was so beautiful to be with them, but everything outside the RV was scary and unknown,\" said Jennings, looking through mirrored aviator sunglasses like those his father favored, his dark hair falling past his shoulders and scraggly beard telegraphing the image of a Southern rocker. Although his albums with his hard-edged alt-country band the .357s tested the boundaries of mainstream tastes, \"Black Ribbons\" has bypassed those limits entirely, crafting a darkly atmospheric rock concept album about the last voice of true freedom in the land, a freewheeling late-night talk-show DJ called Will O' the Wisp, voiced by King.\nFans of Pink Floyd's \"The Wall,\" Roger Waters' \"Radio KAOS\" and Nine Inch Nails' \"The Downward Spiral\" will likely be empathetic to Jennings' album, with its searing extended guitar solos, spacey synthesizer textures and frequent bone-rattling hard-rock rhythms.\nThe effect of \"Black Ribbons\" is heightened considerably by King's droll, seemingly off-the-cuff riffs, full of righteous indignation and underlying humor as he rails against mounting government oppression and champions the importance of the voice of the individual to counter it. The album's conceit is that Will O' the Wisp is about to be shut down by the forces of conformity; he's making his last stand playing music by Hierophant, the fictional name Jennings has given the .357s for this project.\n\"It's a tremendously spooky idea,\" King, who had admired the .357s music he'd heard, said in a separate interview about his reasons for volunteering his services. \"He sent me a draft, and it was just about perfect. I altered a few things and expanded some of it, but he knew exactly what he wanted. . . . To me, it was brilliant, the way the talk and the music weave in and out. I haven't heard the final version, but I heard a rough mix I thought was pretty good, even though I'm not in love with the sound of my own voice.\"\nNot only hasn't King heard the finished version of the album, he and Jennings have never met, nor spoken by telephone. Jennings, a longtime fan of King's writing, originally reached out to the author by e-mail, which is how their whole collaboration was conducted. King recorded his bits at a studio in Florida and sent the digital files back to Jennings, who inserted them into the music he'd",

He's also going on tour in April.\n\"We're trying to bring people into this in as many ways as possible,\" he said. \"It's almost like it's the best time for art right now but the worst time for commerce. . . . When you're broke, making money appear during an economic crisis is very hard.\"\nJennings will soon find out whether anyone will buy \"Black Ribbons.\" But creating a hit wasn't the point.\n\"Ultimately,\" he said, \"it was really pure and inspiration-driven, like if nothing ever happens with it, we know we've done something that we like.\""

The Values Council was formed by the World Economic Forum in response to the current economic crisis – a crisis of values – to realign our collective mindset and develop practical approaches for a more moral economy. New challenges call for new approaches, and we hope that with this hackathon as the starting point, the Council can engage the tech and creative communities in an ongoing constructive dialogue on how technology, and especially social technology, can change corporate behavior. This need for behavior change, for “reinventing business,” is an urgent one.\nWhile most companies will subscribe to that point of view, the disconnection between business and society (and, as studies show, between management and employees) is indisputable. From Occupy Wall Street to public resignation letters in the New York Times, the widening ‘trust gap’ between business and society can’t be ignored.\nIn a recent column, The Economist contends that companies should worry less about their reputations and more about how they do business. And indeed, increasingly, consumers and citizens demand that companies match their words to their actions, far beyond just Mission Statements, Codes of Conduct, and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs. For today’s consumers and citizens, integrity means that a firm’s decisions and behaviors are fundamentally and consistently aligned with its values and principles as well as those of its stakeholders (which include society at large). Our current crises – financial, environmental, employment, debt, or otherwise – are not the result of unforeseen disasters or natural market cycles, they are the result of our behavior, of how we have been acting as people and institutions.\nYet the crisis of capitalism is not only a crisis of character, it is also one of purpose and meaning. With a growing number of employees expressing a strong desire for a purpose beyond profits and of consumers to buy from conscientious companies, and even the Harvard Business Review espousing happiness as a new economic paradigm, this appears to be a ripe time for reinvention. As the world becomes more interconnected and interdependent, the lines between the corporate and the social, the professional and the personal blur, and the younger generation of netizens in particular expects heightened levels of transparency, responsibility, and inspiration – both as consumers and employees. Being “In Search of Excellence” therefore no longer suffices; companies and their leaders now need to pursue significance.\nAchieving this vision requires innovations in two key dimensions of our economy: what we consider to be “value” and the values that guide how we create it. We need a more inclusive value definition that is respectful of all stakeholders’ needs, fully aligned with human values, and transcending the merely transactional, and we need inclusive models of value-creation that are inherently social. We can indeed generate value from values.\nOne of the biggest barriers to broad adoption of this idea is the reality that for too long we have been measuring our successes and failures based on 19th and 20th century notions of growth and productivity. There is an old adage that “you manage what you measure.” We have become great at measuring “how much” and have made it our habit to manage in “how much” terms – as in “how much” GDP, debt, stimulus, resource, revenue, profit, friends, followers, page views etc. In our more interconnected and interdependent world, questions of “how much” matter much less than the question of HOW (i.e. HOW we think, behave, lead, govern, operate, consume, engender trust in our relationships, and relate to others). Instead of reflexively asking “how much,” we need new metrics that help us create organizations, societies, institutions, governments, and businesses that mirror our deepest values.\nAt the macro-economic level, Bhutan’s Gross Happiness Index, as an alternative to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), has gained many admirers, and both the French and the UK governments have begun to emulate it. Moreover, there are supra-national organizations and NGOs such as the New Economics Foundation in the UK that have long proposed new indicators of economic progress grounded in the belief that we need a more holistic, integrated understanding of the economy instead of one that is purely based on financial terms.\nWith the rise of “talentism,” the need for a real understanding of the common human values that connect organizations and individuals is becoming ever more important. Transparency, inclusivity, inspiration, and organizational responsiveness are crucial in nurturing businesses’ social fabric and facilitating empathy and collaboration. Yet, the challenge remains: How do we translate these values into day-to-day corporate behavior and into tangible, personal experiences? How can companies become open organizations that harness and build social capital both inside and outside of their institutional boundaries?\nThis is where our “Reinvent Business” hackathon comes in. True reinvention can only happen with multiple stakeholders contributing to the solution, sharing their ideas from the bottom up and not just the top down. Whether it is a mobile app that uses real-time peer feedback from social networks to help address ethical dilemmas, or a data visualization tool that illustrates the unintended consequences and the externalities of decisions, or an ‘empathy app’ that lets you see the world through someone else",
        "baseline": "’s eyes, new concepts need to be created from people willing to collaborate and invent solutions that recognize that we live in a more interconnected and interdependent world, where we rise and fall together.\nTo be clear: We don’t expect this hackathon to produce any silver bullets, nor do we aim to “productize away” the deep and complex challenges of a moral economy and a more human enterprise. But we are poised to spawn a conversation by tackling concrete problem spaces that might inspire further-reaching, broader solutions.\nAmplified by social technology, we have the potential to unleash the humanity inside organizations to change the world in new and positive ways. We have the opportunity to shape new behaviors that create competitive advantages and sources of growth in this new era. We have the ability to change business from within.\n“Reinvent Business” is an initiative for those who recognize the problem and truly wish to be part of the solution. Join us!"

        "prompt": "The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who go about mapping it and labeling it, and, in my case, trying to find it.\nThought itself is something to ponder in the Irish tradition and so, there are lots of concepts in the Irish language involving the mind, dreaming, and imagination.\nI'm only a student myself, so many of the nuances will be lost on me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear native speakers offer more sophisticated thoughts on the vocabulary of Irish thought.\nA long-standing motif in old Irish literature is of the poet drifting into inspiration, often beside a graveyard, with his head nuzzling a tree. The poet goes into a dream-state and experiences a vision referred to as an \"aisling,\" where Ireland appears to them in the form of a woman. The woman can be young and beautiful or old and haggard (often linked to the writer's thoughts on the state of the country at the time). In the 17th and 18th centuries, the \"aisling\" poetic genre became very popular as poets used the vision of Ireland to lament the suffering of Ireland under English rule.\nI would miss something if I called the aisling just a dream. That's why there are so many Irish words for dreams, including \"brionglóid\" (bringlowjuh) or \"taibhreamh\" (tavriv).\nTo be in a dream-like state is to be on a néal eile (nail elluh), another cloud, which implies something about the cloud you’re already coming from. That’s why we say you’re given dhá súile (gaw sooleh) or your súil eile (sool elluh) when you experience clarity of conception: your other eye.\nBut maybe the experience is closer to speabhraídí (spawrawjee), the closest translation I can find being hallucinations. If it’s a nightmare, that’s a tromluí (trumlee) which could be translated as \"a heavy lie-down.\" It feels like a heavy weight, the opposite of a light cloud.\nYou dig? That’s an Irish word: dig – it means \"understand.\" An dtuigeann tú? (on digan too?). Most of the Irish people that flooded into New York spoke Irish, and our slang is peppered with Gaelic remnants. “Dig it” is from the era when step dance morphed into tap.\n\"Jazz\" is another one – an Irish word that means heat or \"teas\" (jass, chass). Spike Slattery made the word common in San Francisco newspapers. You can read about this and other words like pizazz, razzmatazz, sucker and poker from Gaelic slang here.\nBack to some Irish ideas about thinking: how about the head itself?\nAs the temple of the soul, the head or ceann (kyahn) can be translated as both “front” and “end,” as well as both “one” and “sake.” If this seems confusing, you can say it’s \"trí mo cheann\" (tree muh kyahn), “through my head,” because the idea doesn’t seem to have taken root yet.\nThoughts are like that. It's why someone might try to catch them with a thinking cap. Consider that this phrase itself comes from the Irish \"ceap\" (kyap) which means \"think.\"\nOther Irish words for “thought” or “mind” are too many to review in detail here, so I’ll make an incomplete list: smaoineamh (smweeniv); machnamh (mahknuv); cuimhneamh",
        "baseline": " (kwivnuh); intinn (inchin); meabhair (meeowur); and meon (myoan).\nIf you have a deeper thought, in Irish you don’t just have it, you make it, or you go on it: \"marana a dhéanamh\" (marana a yayniv).\nIrish draws on Latin words too, of course, but few European languages have as many native words for the mind as our own. Some of us may have forgotten, but in Irish that’s an active thing: you have to “make forgetting,” \"rinne mé dearmad\" (rinneh may jyarmud), because it takes effort to neglect the riches of nuance.\nDo you have any interesting facts about the concepts of thought, imagination and the mind in the Irish language?

Violent crime peaked in the 1990s, but has steadily declined over the past 20 years. The data analyzed looks at a five-year span, from 2010 to 2014, and ranks Dubuque and Ames as the #1 and #2 cities in the U.S. where crime has plummeted the most.\nIn Dubuque, the five-year decrease in violent crime is 58 percent; Ames boasts a 56 percent drop in violent crime over that same five-year period.

In the Qassam attack, one Israeli was critically injured with shrapnel wounds to the head and a second rocket started a fire at a factory. The evacuated workers were outside as the UN representative’s motorcade pulled up to observe.\nAngered by what many Israelis deem a pervasive anti-Semitic UN approach, as Arbour made her way to Sderot, she was met with a less than warm reception by local residents of what is increasingly becoming described as a ghost town. Residents of Sderot have been relocating elsewhere due to the onslaught of Palestinian Qassam rockets. More than 25 rockets are reported to have been launched from Gaza into Israel in the Monday overnight alone.\nBut, when the rockets landed during her visit, the ‘less than warm reception’ turned to visible anger, as some Israelis began to pelt her car with stones and chant slogans. The rockets were fired by Hamas’ Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, who said that they did not know Arbour would be in Sderot at the time. Certainly had they known, Hamas would not have fired within eyeshot of their recently departed perceived defender.\nThough not directly from her, Arbour’s accompanying UN spokesman, Christopher Gunness, said that Arbour had pressed the Palestinian Authority sternly in meetings with Mahmoud Abbas regarding the launching of the Qassam rockets on Israeli towns. He said also that “The position of the High Commissioner is that Qassam rockets are illegal under international law” because of their inaccuracy.\nShortly after the Qassam attack on the civilians of Sderot, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights did not condemn the attack with the conviction displayed in Beit Hanun.

        "prompt": "The company plans to cross an important technology threshold midway through the decade, squeezing two Itanium chips onto a single slice of silicon.\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--Intel plans to cross an important technology threshold midway through the decade by squeezing two Itanium chips onto a single slice of silicon.\nchipmakers can unite pairs of processors so they're etched onto a single slice of silicon, making the chips less expensive and therefore more competitive.\n\"The middle of the decade is when we'll do that,\" said Mike Fister, general manager of Intel's Enterprise Platforms Group, at a news conference at the Intel Developer Forum here on Tuesday. Intel will make the move either using its next-generation manufacturing process, which can create circuitry with 90-nanometer features, or using the 65-nanometer generation after that, Fister said.\nSo far, only IBM sells servers with these \"dual-core\" chips, but Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard are working on their own designs, expected as soon as next year. Intel's Itanium, a brand-new design requiring different software than that used with its Pentium and Xeon chips, is designed to compete with these server chips. The 64-bit chip is used mainly in high-end servers that typically run four or more processors.\nDual-core designs could help Intel lower Itanium's price tag enough so that it becomes appropriate for cost-conscious markets, where server sales are currently high, said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood.\n\"Right now, Itanium is stuck in a relatively low-volume niche. The challenge for Intel is how to migrate Itanium down into all but maybe the $2,000-to-$3,000 price bands,\" Brookwood said. \"A dual-core chip could help them do that.\"\nWith each new manufacturing-process generation, circuitry becomes smaller, and more tiny computing switches, called transistors, can be fitted on a single silicon chip. Chip designers face the job of finding the best use for all the new transistors at their disposal, and building dual-core processors is one route.\nThe bigger the processor, the later the transition to dual-core chips can be made. Itanium, at about 400 to 450 square millimeters in size, \"is about as big a chip as anybody's ever manufactured,\" Brookwood said. Itanium 2 currently is built on a 180-nanometer process, but the third-generation \"Madison\" chip will be built on a 130-nanometer process and thus will shrink to about 200 to 300 square millimeters, Brookwood said.\nWith 90-nanometer manufacturing, an Itanium would be about 150 square millimeters,",
        "baseline": " Brookwood said, so a dual-core Itanium would be roughly 300 square millimeters, a practical size.\nMadison is scheduled to arrive in the summer of 2003, said Mike Graf, product line manager for Itanium.\nIn branding strategy, Intel will re-use the Itanium 2 name for Madison, though with some variation so it can be distinguished from the current \"McKinley\" generation. Intel decided to use the same name because Madison chips can be plugged into the exact same computers that use today's Itanium 2 systems, he said.\nIntel is preparing a lower-end Itanium 2 as well, code-named Deerfield. Deerfield will be designed to consume less power, thereby generating less waste heat and becoming better suited to smaller servers.\nFister said Deerfield will consume between 70 and 80 watts, a little more than the 60 to 70 watts of Pentium processors but significantly less than the 120 watts typically used by today's Itanium 2."

        "prompt": "This was Reinsdorf's reply on Friday when asked whether the preseason announcement that Phil Jackson will not return as coach of the Bulls next season is, as the French saying goes, a fact accomplished.\nAnd the notation on the desk of Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago Bulls, also indicates his position regarding Michael Jordan's often-stated contention that he will play for no other coach than Jackson, and he will play for no other team than the Bulls, which would mean no Jordan filling up the nets next season.\nThe Bulls make their final regular-season appearance at Madison Square Garden this afternoon against the Knicks, and it seems inconceivable that Jordan will not return for yet another year, and that neither Jackson nor Scottie Pippen will be with the Bulls, either.\nJordan, still the world's greatest hoopster, is leading the National Basketball Association in scoring for the 10th time in his 14 seasons. Even at age 35, he is playing as good an all-round game as ever. Fans, players and team executives know this, so it can hardly be lost on Jordan himself.\nIt is also obvious that His Airness -- a little less airy these days and a little more earthy but ever sovereign -- is having a grand time at his occupation, and satisfying that remarkable lust for competition and success that has made him an indomitable basketball player.\nJordan has changed his mind before, remember. He quit basketball to play baseball and quit baseball to play basketball.\nBut hadn't decisions already been made? As recently as early February, Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, reiterated that Jackson would not return next season, after having led the Bulls to five championships and, if the best-laid plans of Krause and his men do not go awry, to a sixth come June.\nThe personality, or perhaps ego, clash between Jackson and Krause is no secret. While he hired Jackson, Krause also believes that after a certain time, a general manager and a coach may tire of each other, as, has been said, Jerry West and Pat Riley did with the Lakers, thereby compelling a change.\nIn fact, personality clashes between Krause and some of his players, including Pippen and Jordan, and assistant coaches over the years have been no secret. It seems, however, that Krause has had no such conflict with the owner of the team. But it also seems clear that Reinsdorf has sought for Krause and staff to zipper their lips in regard to what may transpire at season's end.\nStill, Reinsdorf's respect for Krause as a basketball operative is lofty, and for good reason. Krause became general manager in 1985, the year after Jordan was drafted. Six seasons later, the Bulls won the first of their championships.\n''Everyone on the first championship team except Jordan was acquired by Krause,'' Reinsdorf said. That included Pippen, astutely attained in a trade for his draft rights and now seemingly headed elsewhere next season as a free agent, although who knows for sure.\nPippen, who will be 33 in September, doesn't talk to Krause, but he does talk to Reinsdorf. And while Pippen is said to be seeking a huge five-year contract, Reinsdorf said he had yet to hear anything like that from Pippen, who has been bitter about what the Bulls have been paying him but has also been making plenty of money with endorsements.\nKrause took a chance on Dennis Rodman. He found a place for Steve Kerr. He traded a nonentity, Stacey King, for center Luc Longley. He traveled for years to Europe to court Toni Kukoc, and finally snared him. He saw the possibilities in Ron Harper's career being revived.\nYes, Krause has had Jordan all this time, but Jordan found that he couldn't do it alone. He didn't win his first championship until his seventh season in the league -- with a requisite ''supporting cast,'' as Jordan termed it.\nKrause has surely made mistakes, too, such as some draft picks.\nKrause, meanwhile, sometimes says things without a veneer of suavity. He can rankle in his bluntness, or, sometimes, in his evasiveness. And possibly he is frustrated in not receiving much of the due he believes he",

But the odds of Jackson returning appear healthy, as well, especially if the Bulls win another title.\nIf there is one exception to ''Nothing is written in stone,'' it is this: It's a bottom-line game."

Heat coach Erik Spoelstra spent the entire training camp drilling his players on the idea of a free-flowing, equal-opportunity offense. That Bosh, Mr. Random Guy, emerged from training camp as the team’s leading scorer means the Heat’s offense is healthy heading into the season opener against the Celtics on Tuesday at AmericanAirlines Arena.\nMore often than not, Bosh is open on the offensive end. The ball found him during the preseason, and Bosh’s skills did the rest. He led the Heat in field-goal percentage (.551) while also leading the team in rebounds (43).\nJames is the driving force behind Spoelstra’s idea of “positionless basketball,” but Bosh might be the second-most important cog in the wheel. On most nights, Bosh is the quickest big man on the floor, and his consistent jump shot allows him to stretch defenses.\nConventional defensive strategy against the Heat calls for packing the paint to account for Wade and James. Entering his third season with the Heat, Bosh knows where to find the open spots on the periphery.

And should the rest of the world be worried?\n-Creativity isn’t encouraged: Segal argued that while we focus on the “hardware”—the more tangible results of innovation, like patents filed—China needs to focus on the “software” problems of culture. In China, researchers aren’t urged to think creatively, nor do they feel free to fail. “No risk, no reward” may be a cliché, but it is also a truism.\n-Quantity is valued over quality: According to Huang, the number of journal articles published by Chinese researchers has exploded in recent years. But outside of the life sciences and biology, the level of impact from this research has remained fairly flat—indicating that the research is not high-quality. In part, this may be because researchers are paid per publication, so repetitive research and short-term work is incentivized.\n-Intellectual property rights are not respected: Since patents and copyrights are frequently violated, there is less incentive to create.\nChina’s leadership understands all of these things, said Segal. In fact, they have probably visited Silicon Valley “more than anyone,” he joked. Accordingly, China’s 2006 mid- to long-term plan for science and technology development emphasized the need for better intellectual property protection, for startup culture. But politically, introducing these elements will be very difficult—especially, as Simon noted, because the politicians have other significant worries on their minds, like domestic protests. Still, they understand that the “transition to a knowledge economy” is critical, and accordingly they want to be the No. 1 or No. 2 country in the world for innovation by 2049—China’s centennial. That’s one reason why they",
        "baseline": " are expanding investment into R&D, going from 1 percent of GDP for a long time to 2 percent of GDP in 2011. But China isn’t doing this only for financial reasons, according to Segal—the country also wants not to have to depend on the West for its technological and scientific needs.\nThere are some positive signs here for China. For instance, Simon said that more and more research funding is coming in at the local level, not from the national government—a “systemic change,” he termed it. And while many Western companies opened their research labs in China initially because the government effectively made it a condition for selling goods in the country, said Sun, they are increasingly producing interesting work. No breakthroughs yet, he acknowledged, but they may come soon. China’s most successful fields—nanotechnology, life sciences, biology—are those that have been open to international collaboration.\nWatch the entire event on the New America Foundation website."

        "prompt": "Question: What's one company culture characteristic that you have found makes your startup employees the happiest? How do you make sure you're implementing it?\n\"Every six weeks, we have scheduled, highly structured bi-directional reviews with every employee. The predictability and structure of these meetings make it extremely easy for employees to deliver feedback, both good and bad. This level of transparency and communication keeps employees happy and motivated.\"\n\"At RTC, we have a motto as a publisher: \"Don't expect your reader to change through reading your book if you haven't changed through writing it.\" That motto defines our core belief that continual growth is necessary for the human spirit to regularly experience joy in the workplace. As a result, our executive team strives to help our staff remove aspects of their work that do not bring them joy so that they can focus on what they love doing. By intentionally making room for them to focus on what they enjoy, they are able to grow out aspects of the business that bring them deep personal satisfaction while also serving our clients. We've developed entire new lines of business this way, as well as new positions within the company. Support their dreams, and they will grow your business.\"\nFollow Rule #2: Have Fun!\n\"When my co-founder and I started 'ZinePak, our business plan read simply, \"Make money. Have fun.\" As the company has grown, we've made sure not to lose sight of this mission. At the end of each day, we ask our employees if they had fun that day. Almost without fail, the answer is always \"yes.\" We try to always remember that we're an entertainment company. We aren't changing the world. We aren't curing cancer. No one's life is at risk, so there is no need for the doom-and-gloom culture that seems so prevalent in Corporate America. From half-day Fridays to candy jars to days off for charitable activities of the employee's choice, we try to mix \"fun\" into everything possible to ensure that work feels as much like play as possible.\"\n\"We always take time to celebrate our wins. Whether it's a new project, new teammate or new launch, we take time to recognize team and individual successes. Taking small breaks to socialize and catch up at team happy hours reenergizes the team and ultimately leads to awesome workflow and collaboration. Our internal party planning committee makes consistent plans to pull us away from our desks and into fun environments where we can take our minds off work for a bit.\"\n\"I think that people are generally happiest at work when they are engaged by the work that they do. Doing the same jobs, having the same responsibilities and facing the same tasks day in and day out can get tiresome. In my company, there is a variety of work to be done, and employees are encouraged to embrace the variety. This keeps work fresh. We also support telecommuting (to the degree that we don't even have a \"home\" office -- all work is done \"off-site\") and flexible schedules. We trust our team to do their work when they can and where they can. Work variety and flexible work results in employees who are happy and productive. \"\n\"When we started, we had been told to be careful of what we share with our employees and other stakeholders. We, however, are very open and transparent communicators and did not keep anything confidential and didn't hold back any information. This allowed our early employees to not only feel like they were playing an important trusted role in making an impact on growing the company, but also allowed them to dissent and suggest better ways of accomplishing objectives. They respected the founders because they saw not just what decisions we made, but how we made them, right or wrong. And for failed experiments, we had their support and morale to pivot quickly. Each and everyone felt individual ownership for each decision and worked that much harder to succeed, because they never felt separate.\"\n\"Every other Friday, someone different leads our team workout. We've played tennis and basketball, done yoga and CrossFit and even learned (barely) various martial arts. Unintentionally, we've taken risks doing new things, discussed how we're improving our lives (not just our work) and laughed a lot. The benefits of exercise combined with the additional vulnerability, camaraderie and fun has increased the happiness quotient of Team Fig. \"\n\"When people hear the words \"company culture,\" they often think about ping pong tables or beer taps. While those sorts of perks are cool, they really don't matter unless you've created the right work environment to embrace them. You create that environment by giving people a voice.",
        "baseline": " When we built our new corporate office space, it was very important to solicit opinions and ideas from our employees. Before moving into our new facility in 2011, we hosted an internal version of Pinterest where employees could put ideas and pictures that they felt should be considered for the new space and workstation setups. In the end, when you're making a decision based on democratic feedback, you need transparency. People will be invested in the outcome as long as they feel like the process is fair. \"\n\"The characteristic that I swear by is living the mission every day. Oftentimes, people join your team/company as a startup because you are doing something different or you're doing something the way no one has done it before. You cannot afford to lose that, and you have to live that everyday. For us, that is our mission. Everyone who has joined our team is in it for the mission, and we push it and live it every day, which makes our team members happy. \""

Charles and Anatole both think the dollar rally will continue, though Anatole thinks it will not strengthen against the euro.\nLouis has a more nuanced opinion, which I'll quote in full.\nIt all depends on what happens to return on invested capital. Whether the US dollar rises or falls will be the primary driver of performance for almost any asset class in 2017.\nIf no, then the dollar falls back, US equities underperform, and emerging market debt outperforms big-time.\nIs it at the expense of ROIC outside the US (i.e., protectionism)? If so, then the concern is that we are seeing a rearrangement of the post-World War II world order. In this case, the US will no longer be willing to provide excess liquidity when needed through a widening current account deficit. Investors should start worrying about a global depression and consider buying long-dated treasuries pretty soon.\nIs it through tax cuts and deregulation? If so, then real rates should rise, and the whole world will grow faster. In this environment, sell all assets that have done well from financial engineering, scarcity assets (gold, art, collectibles), and private equity; and buy cyclicals and financials everywhere.\nSo far, the market is clearly pricing in this latter scenario.\nI agree with this logic, and I think the full answer is still pending.

        "prompt": "On Washington’s trendy H Street corridor, the just-built Lucille Condominium boasts a classic-meets-contemporary facade of old-school red bricks and sleek, squared-off balconies. Inside, the mixture of influences continues in the Art Deco-ish penny tile bathroom floors, the bungalow-style five-panel wood doors, and the kitchens with Shaker-inspired shiny black cabinets and gleaming brass hardware.\nThanks to websites, blogs, Pinterest boards, Instagram feeds and television shows, everyday home-dwellers have access to countless decor ideas. A decade ago, only design-world savants and Moroccans were plopping Morocco’s graphic black-on-white Beni Ourain wool rugs on their floors. Now, with even big-box stores getting into design, you can buy knockoffs at Target, and the hashtag #beniourain has been used 31,000 times (and counting) on Instagram. But it’s anyone’s guess how long the fad will last.\n“Remember how popular sponge painting was in the 1990s, and how chevron was on ­everything in the early 2000s?” says Needham, Mass., interior ­designer Dina Holland, whose popular Instagram account @pleasehatethesethings showcases regrettable interior trends and choices.\nSo, how do keep your pad from looking dated just a few years after you put in a new powder room, replace the great room sofa or hang up groovy-again wallpaper in your foyer? Here are seven tips from designers.\n“I try to avoid anything that is too ornamental, too loud or that’s been all over social media,” says Bethesda interior designer Marika Meyer. “There’s a point at which, if everyone is doing one thing — strong geometric tile, ikat fabric — you might consider going with something completely different that’ll look unique and individual.” Meyer, for example, recently helped a client install a new kitchen with lacquered, turquoise blue cabinets. “They’re bold and fun, and it’s not something you see everywhere,” Meyer says. And, she says, it will last longer since it doesn’t hew to a particular trend.\nClean lines and neutral colors, while not the stuff of Instagram likes, will probably outlast current obsessions such as patterned cement tiles and benches upholstered with ratty sheepskins. Design pros preach that the backbones of your home — floors, walls and major furniture — should skew toward simplicity. In a decade, that swoop-armed Pottery Barn sofa might feel more tired than a low-slung, squared-off midcentury modern couch.\nHolland says she sometimes gets pushback from clients when she presents a design proposal with neutral base elements. “They’ll sometimes say, ‘That’s boring,’ but I emphasize that the way to do these trends — macramé, a bold pattern — is in a pillow or a small area rug,” she says. It’s akin to shelling out for the little black designer dress you’ll wear forever, then dolling it up with this season’s necklace and shoes.\nSome pared-down ideas — popular white subway tiles, white kitchen cabinets and Eames chairs — might seem trendy, especially to folks who don’t have deep design knowledge. “But if something keeps coming around again and again, like black-and-white bathrooms, I’d say it�",
        "baseline": "�s classic,” says S2’s Simon.\nInteriors and exteriors can also feel more timeless when they stay somewhat true to the original era of the property, especially if it’s a historic one. “In an old house, I like to keep some of the details and honor them,” Sachs says. That could mean retaining and re-staining the oak moldings and paneling in a Craftsman bungalow, or remodeling the bathrooms of a 1920s rowhouse with simple, black-and-white subway tile — nodding to what might have been there during the Jazz Age. “And I wouldn’t put a bunch of dark wood, Queen Anne furniture in a 1950s ranch house,” Kahoe says. An ideal blend? A look that considers the house’s architecture and roots along with whatever HGTV’s “Property Brothers” are installing this ­season."

A much greater number of women than men admitted to turning on the waterworks on the job -- 41% of women surveyed compared to 9% of men surveyed.\n\"People of all levels of management have cried,\" Kreamer says. \"That belief that if you cry at work you won't achieve the highest levels -- it's simply false.\"\nSometimes it's work, sometimes it's personal and sometimes it's just happening -- and there's nothing you can do but ride out the wave.\nHere are some tips on how to show a little emotion at work, without losing the respect of your peers.\nWe may want to pretend like our crying episode never happened, but if you don't own up to it and discuss it with your colleagues, they're open to interpret your red eyes or sniffy nose as something much more serious or worrisome.\n\"Just a few words can give someone enough context to say 'OK, it's not about me. It's not about this situation,'\" said Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, management and organizations professor at the University of Michigan.\nWhen journalist Katie Hawkins-Gaar's husband died earlier this year, she took a three-month sabbatical before returning to her job at Poynter (Hawkins-Gaar previously worked for CNN). When she did, she had a crying plan in place, along with a pin that proudly declares her a member of \"team cry.\"\nHawkins-Gaar's tips for crying at work: wear waterproof mascara.

I've just been having much more productive conversations with my boss and other colleagues because they're empathetic to where I'm at.\"\nMost would agree that bursting into tears in front of other people -- in a meeting, in the boss's office, at your desk -- is the least ideal scenario.\n\"It's not going to do anybody any good if you're just sitting at your desk sobbing, right?\" Hawkins-Gaar says. \"Find a place, whether it's a bathroom stall or a quick walk around the building or even a trusted colleague you could talk to and blow off some steam with.\"\nThe idea here is not to try to hide your crying, but instead to take a break. Stepping away gives you some room to breathe (and yes, maybe to cry).\nAs Sanchez-Burks says, \"Crying is emotional information.\"\nPay attention to what your tears are telling you. After your cry, take a second to self-reflect. Ask yourself what prompted the sobs. Are you stressed? Hungry? Fatigued? Fed up?\n\"If somebody feels such a powerful emotion, there's something that needs to be brought into the open,\" Sanchez-Burk",

Maybe it's time to figure out the common denominator that keeps upsetting you.\n\"If you go home every day and cry, my supposition is that you are not in the correct job,\" Kreamer says. \"It's an opportunity to step back and say 'I'm clearly miserable. Why do I feel trapped? Why is nobody hearing me?'\"\nWhen Hawkins-Gaar was managing her own team at work, she paid special attention when an employee cried. She recognized it as a signal that something else was afoot.\nAnd when she'd feel the urge to cry herself, she'd use it as an opportunity to have a bigger conversation.\n\"I'm a big fan of the idea that there's power in vulnerability, and if you're showing your team 'I'm a human being and here's what's going on with me,' you're telling them that you trust them with that information,\" she says."

She said she did not want to limit the state's aid distribution to a per pupil basis since some towns, especially smaller ones, might not fare as well under that aid system.\nBoth amendments contain the word \"reasonably,\" which some legal experts argue would lower the court's standard of review of education aid issues.\nSmith, D-Durham, disagreed. \"The word reasonably is in there to provide encouragement to those people who believe the court might have been too demanding on the Legislature,\" she said.\nEducation is a fundamental right in the state, she added.\n\"What this amendment is designed to do is to clarify how the state can best fulfill its obligations,\" she said. \"The Legislature — and each successive Legislature — will have control to determine that if only so much money",
        "baseline": " is available to education, it can target it without having first paid all of the costs covered by a definition (of adequacy),\" she said.\nSmith said her amendment is what Lynch and Republicans wanted.\nLawmakers have been struggling with school funding since a landmark state Supreme Court ruling in 1997 found the state's reliance on widely varying local property taxes unconstitutional. A recent study by the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies found that per-pupil spending has risen overall since then, but poor towns have not gained ground on towns with greater property tax wealth.\nLynch and other legislative leaders believe making the state pay the full cost of an adequate education in every community would create an intolerable financial burden, without necessarily making schools better.\nTwo years ago, Lynch proposed a school aid plan that phased out aid to wealthier towns.\nThe Legislature is working to meet a July 1 Supreme Court deadline to define an adequate education. Lawmakers plan to determine its cost and how to distribute aid later."

        "prompt": "Like any energetic 7-year-old, your daughter loves running around outside, playing with her friends and kicking around a soccer ball. So you’re concerned when she starts losing energy. She looks pale and refuses to eat. You take her to the pediatrician, and her test results show the worst: she has leukemia. Once you work through the shock, you do you what any parent would do: find the best possible care to get her through it. But where do you go?\nHealth care for children is different from care for adults. Treating kids requires doctors who are experienced with their unique needs, and according to Stanford pediatricians Paul Wise and Lisa Chamberlain, this experience is developed and lives in children’s hospitals.\nAnd these facilities are highly dependent on Medicaid.\n“Children are the poorest segment of the United States population,” said Wise, a Stanford Health Policy core faculty member.\nNearly one out of every five children lives below the poverty line, according to the United States Census Bureau. Very few children need extensive health care, but of those that do, about 44 percent rely on Medicaid or other public insurance programs.\nBecause so many of their patients use Medicaid, these children’s hospitals need reimbursements from the program to support their services. Without this income, some might have to downsize or even shut down, and if they do, services would suffer for all children.\nIf the American Health Care Act (the Republican replacement for Obamacare) passes Congress, Medicaid will convert to a per capita cap system. Instead of providing coverage to all who meet its criteria — which is primarily based on income and need — the federal government would cap how much money the federal government could provide each person.\nWise and Chamberlain worry that a set amount allocated for states or individuals would not be able to keep up with health industry",
        "baseline": " inflation, causing payments to effectively decrease over time. They are also concerned that children would be particularly affected by these changes because their medical needs are so different from adults’.\nNot only would the funds available for child health coverage erode, but according to Wise, the focus on adult health concerns in the emerging Medicaid changes could, without immediate attention, undermine 40 years of progress in developing strong, regionalized child health systems.\nProviding for children’s needs should be simple because their expenditures are relatively low. Child health care makes up less than nine percent of all federal health expenditures in the United States.\nBut because the health policy debate in the United States focuses on older populations, children are often left out.\n“I think it’s really important that we have these conversations about the unique needs of children,” said Chamberlain.\nWise and Chamberlain hope to alert policy-makers to the fiscal needs of children and how they affect care for all kids."

        "prompt": "Rehberg attacks lobbyists, while son represents Mongolian government in D.C.\nHELENA - U.S. Rep. Denny Rehberg has made a point of criticizing Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's campaign money ties to lobbyists in their battle for the U.S. Senate, but the Republican has been less vocal about his son's position as an executive with a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm.\nRehberg's son A.J. Rehberg, who has worked at GAGE since 2008, more recently became the point man for the Mongolian government's interests on Capitol Hill. But Rehberg says there is no conflict of interest and he has done due diligence in asking the House ethics committee for guidance in the situation.\nThe congressman was told lawmakers' family members are not prohibited from working at a lobbying firm. GAGE also employs former Republican U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns.\n\"There is no law, rule, or standard of conduct that absolutely prohibits a family member from accepting employment with a lobbying firm, or even engaging in lobbying-related activities,\" ethics committee leaders told Rehberg in a letter.\nRehberg was advised to establish an office policy prohibiting lobbying of his office by his son as a safeguard, even though A.J. is not a registered lobbyist, and to warn GAGE not to advertise the relationship in attracting clients. He was also told to make sure GAGE was not given extra influence as a result of hiring his son as a vice president.\n\"But Denny and A.J. have taken it a step further, establishing a professional firewall. There's an understanding between them that they just don't talk shop together,\" said spokesman Jed Link. \"Denny also made it perfectly clear to GAGE that hiring A.J. would neither help nor hurt their standing with him or his office. A.J. being on staff has no impact whatsoever.\"\nAlthough A.J. Rehberg is not a registered lobbyist for his work with GAGE, the Embassy of Mongolia considers the congressman's son \"the primary point of contact for the firm's work with the embassy.\"\nThe embassy said in a news release earlier this year that it has hired GAGE to be its first-ever lobbying firm in Washington, D.C. GAGE says on its website that it represents Mongolia to both Congress and the administration.\nBut regulatory paperwork shows that GAGE principal Leo Giacometto does the official lobbying work for the Mongolians. GAGE did not return a call Tuesday seeking comment.\nThe Mongolian embassy counts Rep. Rehberg among about a dozen House members who are part of the U.S.-Mongolia Friendship Caucus established to strengthen relations between the two countries.\nRehberg, the Republican, is pitted against U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, the Democrat, in an intense race. Rehberg has attacked Tester for taking more campaign donations from lobbyists than anyone else in Congress, and the Republican campaign has suggested the donations could lead to improper influence.\nThe issue has attracted the attention of CREW, or Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The watchdog group recently asked the State Department, in a public records request, if Rehberg has ever written the agency on behalf of GAGE or its Mongolian interests.\n\"We are routinely concerned with the issue of members of Congress using their position as profit centers for their families. In this situation it would seem that Mr. Rehberg's son may be profiting from his father's position in Congress,\" said CREW executive director Melanie Sloan.\nSloan said that any potential clients of GAGE would know the Rehberg name and be able to quickly associate A.J. to his father even if GAGE does not advertise the association. She said it would be hard for Rehberg to claim the high ground in a debate over the influence of lobbyists.\n\"For him to holler about anyone else's Washington connections is ridiculous and hypocritical,\" Sloan said.\nThe GAGE firm has deep ties to Montana, hiring Burns after he was ousted by Tester in 2006.\nIronically, GAGE until recently also briefly employed a well-known Democratic operative and former Tester employee that played a critical role in beating Burns. But Matt McKenna, who used to work for Tester and is now a consultant to former president Bill Clinton and others, says he is no longer working with GAGE.\nTester's office, which says former staffers are banned from lobbying the office, said Tuesday it however has no control over where former staffers choose to work and has no comment on those choices.\nTester's campaign didn't offer much comment on the employment of Rehberg's son as a lobbyist.\n\"This campaign will remain focused on what's best for Montana and this nation, and Congressman Re",
        "baseline": "hberg's record - not his children,\" said Tester campaign manager Preston Elliott.\nGAGE has unique ties to Mongolia, in addition to representing the country's interests in the United States.\nA.J. Rehberg is also a vice president at a Mongolian uranium mining company called Mongolia Forward, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C. Several other GAGE employees are directors or advisers at the company, including Burns and Giacometto, known to many in Montana as a former state legislator and appointee in the administration of former Gov. Judy Martz.\nMongolia Forward says on its website it is trying to secure permits to start the mining venture.\nGAGE also leads several other Mongolian business ventures, such as a fiber optic network company, and GAGE is part owner of a Pepsi bottling operation in that country.\n\"GAGE was instrumental in securing the exclusive Pepsi bottling and distribution rights in Mongolia,\" the company's website reads."

        "prompt": "Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have joined a record-setting cohort of independents and MPs from 'unrecognized' parties.\nIf a group of crows is called a 'murder', an assembly of ferrets is a 'business' and a collection of owls is a 'parliament', what do you call a row of independent MPs?\nA 'schism' of independents? A 'motley', perhaps? How about an 'insurrection'?\nWith the ejection of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus this week, the number of independent MPs in the House of Commons has exploded. Coupled with the other MPs representing an array of 'unrecognized' parties ranging from the secessionist to the populist and the extinct, the number of MPs in the House who do not belong to officially recognized parties is at an all-time high.\nThere are now seven Independents in the House. Along with Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, the list includes former Liberals Celina Caesar-Chavannes, Raj Grewal, Darshan Kang and Hunter Tootoo, as well as Tony Clement, a former Conservative.\nThat's not an abnormally high number for the tail end of a majority government's term. There were eight independents when the House was dissolved ahead of the 2015 federal election. There were nine just before the 2004 election.\nThe number of Independents hit a modern high in 1990 as well, when there were 11 of them in the House — the bulk of them former Liberal or PC MPs who eventually would form the Bloc Québécois.\nBut any party with less than 12 seats in the House of Commons goes \"unrecognized\" — which means it isn't guaranteed slots in question period, seats on committees or the extra resources that are awarded to larger parties. Instead, these parties need to share their speaking time in the House with other Independents; in the current Parliament, that means 14 questions a week are divvied up between the 20 MPs from unrecognized parties or sitting as Independents.\nThose unrecognized parties are the Bloc Québécois (10 MPs), Greens (Elizabeth May) and the People's Party (Maxime Bernier).\nThen there's Erin Weir, who was booted from the New Democratic caucus last year. He is sitting as a self-appointed member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, a forerunner party to the NDP that has not existed for more than half a century.\nWeir has been pushing Speaker Geoff Regan for more questions for the growing crew of Independents.\n\"The independent group is by far the fastest-growing parliamentary caucus,\" Weir said in a statement following Caesar-Chavannes's departure from the Liberal caucus in March. \"We need more spots in question period to reflect our numbers.\"\nHe repeated that call this week when the cohort of Independents grew by two.\nIn an October 2018 ruling, Regan said that the 14 questions awarded to Independents was already high, adding that \"never have independent members been recognized as much during question period.\" He also reminded the House that question period is only supposed to last 45 minutes and the additional questions given to Independents are already routinely pushing question period well beyond that duration.\nSmall parties only began receiving recognition in the House in 1963, during a period of minority governments when the New Democrats and Social Credit held a lot of sway in the legislature. At the time, the bar of 12 seats was set to give leaders of these smaller parties a bump in salary, like the one given to the leader of the Official Opposition. The threshold of 12 seats then evolved to become the benchmark for a number of other parliamentary privileges.\nWatch Vassy Kapelos explain what it means to be an independent MP.\nTheoretically, Weir could acquire these privileges by getting his unrecognized colleagues to form a caucus of their own — like the Independent Senators Group in the Senate.\nOf course, that would mean somehow uniting Caesar-Chavannes, Philpott and Wilson-Raybould with Kang, Tootoo, Clement and Grewal — Independents who are alleged to have committed, or have admitted to committing, various improprieties. It also would require finding common ground between May and Bernier and getting the Bloc on board.\nParliament has seen plenty of caucuses divided against themselves, but such an Independent caucus would set a new bar for internal turmoil. Obviously, it isn't happening.\nBut the numbers make it possible — which is pretty remarkable on its own.\nAt the end of the last Parliament, the total number of Independents and MPs from unrecognized parties just ticked over the 12-seat threshold. But that also was a group of MPs with irreconcilable differences — representatives of the Greens, the Bloc and Strength in Democracy (remember them?), along with a clutch of cast-off Independents.\nBefore that, you have to go back to the 35th Parliament that sat between 1994 and 1997 and included nine New Democrats and two Progressive Conservatives. Add the handful of independents at that time to the mix, and you could have had an unrecognizable — but nevertheless 'recognized' — party.\nBut while it's a bit odd to see",
        "baseline": " so many MPs in the House who don't belong to a recognized party, it's far from unprecedented. What is unique about this group is the large number of them who have held high office in the past.\nAccording to the database maintained by the Library of Parliament, only 18 former cabinet ministers have ever appeared in the Commons as Independents. Of those, four (five if we include Bernier, who briefly sat as an Independent before changing his affiliation to the People's Party) are now sitting in the House of Commons. That's twice the largest number of \"honourable members\" that ever sat previously as independents at the same time.\nThat's a coincidence, of course: very little connects former cabinet ministers Tootoo and Clement to Philpott and Wilson-Raybould, apart from the bad view they now have in the House. But it's another reminder, if any was needed, that the last two months have nudged federal politics into uncharted territory."

His first book, Uprising exploring the phenomena of movements will be published by McGraw Hill soon.\nCan you imagine a city without billboards, business signs or posters? An urban landscape with absolutely no advertising displayed anywhere?\nSeems impossible doesn’t it but that’s exactly what happened in São Paulo, Brazil five years ago when mayor Gilberto Kassab passed a ‘Clean City Law’, banning all visual pollution, i.e. outdoor advertising.\nAlthough most residents welcomed the crackdown, which would help to restore the natural beauty of their city, businesses were uneasy about the move, saying it would surely ruin them.\nYou can see their point when tens of thousands of ads were immediately removed from the streets, destroying any al fresco advertising opportunities whatsoever. Well, certainly in terms of splashing logos, billboards and branding on anything and everything.\nBut did this ‘ad ban’ cause widespread panic and suffering to local firms? Interestingly, it didn’t. Instead, it actually encouraged many companies to reassess their advertising campaigns and find new and improved ways to reach customers. It forced them to stop and think, inventing smart new ways to promote their products and services on the streets without covering up the beautiful architecture of the city.\nThat’s when many stumbled across movement marketing. They realized that in order to reach customers they had to freshen up their act. They had to tap into a culture or common theme. Something that would spark people’s interest and create an emotional connection.\nMany launched their own public stunts or viral campaigns on the streets. Others embraced social media and began to interact directly with their local customers.\nGuerilla marketing became the norm as brands fought for attention to get their marketing messages out there. And do you know what! It worked. The messages started to get through, like never before.\nWhich leads on to the next revelation… Firms realized that they’d never even questioned whether billboards actually worked. They’d never stopped to consider if outdoor advertising was bringing a good return on investment.\nOnce upon a time it did. Back in the old days when there weren’t so many brands around, competing for our attention. But today is a different story. Today, most Americans see around 4,000 ads per day and with that much visual bombardment, it’s a wonder if any message gets through.\nSo the ban taught businesses a valuable lesson. They realized that bombarding people with a visual traffic jam was never going to make an impact. They learnt that one-way advertising doesn’t work anymore. They now understand that interaction is the key to winning customer loyalty and tapping into people’s emotions,",

Their creative folks are today some of the most amazing digital talent in the world.\nCan you imagine your own city without endless posters, clogging up the horizon? It’s entirely possible. São Paulo has done it and is living proof that there’s more to life than billboards. What's next down there? In Spielberg's film Minority Report, outdoor billboards are super digital boards able to react to and engage with each person individually.

People in Louisiana and East Texas are, as of this writing, begging for assistance, and it’s not there. Oh, it’ll get there eventually. After all, FEMA has awarded a whole bunch of no-bid, noncompetitive contracts. And Michael Brown, the incompetent director who was removed from his duties and resigned, is still being paid as a consultant. Only the government would pay a man let go for incompetence as a consultant.\nOf course, after one of the Florida storms last year, FEMA paid out millions of dollars to people in Dade County who had suffered no losses. Just a minor accounting hitch, I suppose. They even paid to bury people who had died of natural causes. But who cares about that? It’s taxpayers’ money, and everybody in Washington treats taxpayer money as if it were play money.\nNow, President Bush, who is the king of bad ideas, is contemplating asking Congress to change the laws so the U.S. military can step in and take charge after catastrophic events. Granted, the military is more competent than FEMA, but putting the military in charge means declaring martial law. The military doesn’t want that job, and it’s not really trained to do it. It has trucks and backs and bulldozers, but its primary training is in fighting a war. Besides, it’s stretched thin as it is. A better idea would be to return the National Guard to state control and stop sending its members overseas.\nThe best performers in the second storm were the state and local officials. They got people evacuated — a great achievement despite the traffic jams. They secured the towns. Now, if FEMA would deliver food, water and fuel, they could get on with cleanup and rebuilding.\nBack in the 1960s and 1970s, when liberals failed to achieve their agenda through the democratic process in state legislatures, they went to the federal courts and asked them to legislate by decree. It was at that time that liberals created the myth that federal was somehow superior to state and local. They created the impression that state and local officials were a bunch of country bumpkins, while federal officials were enlightened philosopher kings.\nThat’s total hokum. In the first place, nearly all federal politicians and officials come from the states. In the second place, a centralized government is unavoidably more inefficient than state and local governments, which are closer to both the problems and the people. The federal government, as it has grown to gargantuan proportions, has grabbed most of the revenue sources, more or less starving the state and local governments. The answer to that problem is devolution. Give the authority and the tax sources back to the state and local governments.\nIf the federal government obeyed the Constitution and did only what it authorizes the federal government to do, it could get by on a comparatively small budget.

        "prompt": "For a short time this summer, Florida State was the rumored target of a Southeastern Conference raid on the Atlantic Coast Conference, in the protracted and sometimes absurd realignment that still is reshaping college football's landscape. Ben Haumiller, a proud Seminole alumnus, knew that change was unlikely in the real world. Florida State burned a bridge when it chose the ACC over the SEC in 1992. But on his Xbox 360, FSU was already lacing up in the nation's premier league.\n\"I'm not gonna lie, when people were whispering that Florida State was going to the SEC, you're damn right I started an NCAA 12 dynasty with Florida State in the SEC,\" said Haumiller, taking advantage of a conference realignment feature incorporated in this year's game. \"And oh God, here I am at Alabama, and Georgia, and at Neyland Stadium hearing 'Rocky Top.' I had a blast doing that.\"\nWhen he goes into work, however, the variables and fantasy scenarios are not all fun and games. Haumiller, the producer of EA Sports' NCAA Football series, is also riding the crest of a wave of change, along with athletics directors, television executives and, yes, fans, coaches and players.\nWhether a conference swells to 22 or even 14, as the SEC will next year, the uncertainty in eight major conference memberships has Haumiller's development team building several contingency plans, and facing a nightmare scenario in which the game released in July 2012 doesn't reflect the reality coming in August.\n\"We're going to go as late as we can possibly go to be correct,\" Haumiller said, acknowledging that uncertainties in the departures of Pitt, Syracuse, and West Virginia from the Big East could be resolved after the game enters its alpha state around April or May. So could the desperate, circle-the-wagons alliance of a proposed Mountain West-Conference USA merger, creating a 22-team megaleague to protect the midweek broadcast viability of college football's have-nots.\nAnyone who has ever built a custom schedule in NCAA Football, especially with an independent team, knows why Haumiller is so concerned. The game's scheduling into future simulated seasons requires a deeply complicated logic, much more than simply following the currently announced schedule of a professional league and its predictable rotation of interdivisional matchups. This schedule touches multiple modes of the game also, from the standard Dynasty, to the Online Dynasty, to its Road to Glory singleplayer.\nThere are 120 teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision (\"major\" college football) this year, and another three come aboard next year. Creating a realistic national schedule that doesn't send Florida Atlantic to Wyoming for no good reason is tough enough. In divining how 12 and 14-team superconferences, which can't play a full round robin among all their league's members, will protect certain annual rivalries and plot future matchups, a Ouija board is as accurate as any current information.\n\"A 22-team conference is something we've never had to deal with before,\" said Haumiller. \"It would break our code,\" as currently written, he said.\nThe current version of NCAA Football, allows users to manipulate the memberships of all existing conferences, expanding or reducing them to 16 or 6 members, if they wish. Automatic major bowl bids and other scheduling parameters also are incorporated. It was a direct response to last year's conference realignment upheaval, which saw two Big 12 teams defect, nearly unraveling the entire league (which remains in a precarious position today).\nHaumiller and company had been planning for everything from unbalanced SEC divisions of eight and six teams, to Auburn shifting to the SEC East.\nYet even that farsighted development isn't enough to get NCAA Football 13 ahead of the news. EA Sports Tiburon still has to be ready to respond at a moment's notice to the latest oddball rumor of a school switching leagues. The SEC just announced that Missouri will be placed in its Eastern division (despite being one of four teams west of the Mississippi). Haumiller and company had been planning for everything from unbalanced divisions of eight and six teams, to Auburn shifting to the SEC East, and trying to predict what that would mean for the Tigers' schedule with rivals Alabama and LSU, and then Georgia as an every-year divisional foe affecting other games.\nHaumiller said his team is building code for NCAA 13 that tries to accommodate scheduling in a 22-team, user-created league—even one jampacked full of traditional rivals like Alabama, Tennessee, Ohio State, Michigan, Cal and Stanford, who stage their matchups on specific dates in the season. But this logic may not make it into the final game. They'll work as long and as far as they can until either real-world events sort themselves out, or the NCAA Football developers have to make a choice between keeping that code and maybe implementing another feature.\nHaumiller said he would prefer for a 22-team scheduling engine to remain in the game, because one of the game's greatest strengths is how users can rearrange conferences between seasons. In essence, if EA Sports gets to a point where it's stamping discs with conference memberships still unresolved, ideally it could still put out a game where users can correct that themselves after spending five minutes in a menu.\n\"If it takes a little amount of work, and removing it would not leave much room for a new feature,\" it'll probably stay, Haumiller said. \"But if it would be a large task to implement, and there's no certainty it will happen (in real life), I could see us making a decision to say, no, this other thing is what we want to get into the game. Do I want to get that in there? Yes. But the reality is we only have a limited amount of time and space.\"\nOne thing the NCAA Football team will not do is implement conference changes in future years, within the game's Dynasty mode. For example, Syracuse and Pitt are technically bound by a 27-month notice that would keep them in the Big East until 2014. Few expect that to hold up; either the universities will buy or sue their way out of the requirement or the Big East will waive it. West Virginia's departure for the Big 12 is similarly clouded.\nThe game won't assume future moves in its Dynasty mode. TCU quit the Big East before playing a down in it.\nHaumiller said conference makeups in the game's Dynasty mode simply can't incorporate conference membership makeups other than those in the current year of release. Had its Dynasty tried to implement changes planned for the future seasons, then in the second year of your NCAA 12 dynasty TCU would have switched to the Big East, as was planned at the time of the game's release. Yet a month ago, the Horned Frogs suddenly announced they were joining the Big 12, before playing a single down in their new conference.\nNCAA Football 12's deep realignment capabilities, introduced this year, are remarkable in what they allow a gamer to do to a licensing body that's usually conservative and keenly observant of traditions. The user could create a college football landscape that straight-up parodies the cynical cash-grab going on. You can reconfigure the widely despised BCS automatic berth structure and rename the divisions of existing 12-team leagues, which would seem to be a swipe at the roundly jeered \"Leaders\" and \"Legends\" divisional names of the Big Ten.\nHaumiller didn't know if a Big Ten representative was in the room when EA Sports presented its game, with the divisional renaming feature, to its licensing partners this year. But the project team has earned the trust of the NCAA, the conferences, and the Collegiate Licensing Company by being responsive to its requests in the past. Divisional renaming was pitched, and approved, as a means of giving users control over modifying conferences and not being stuck with generic \"Division A and B\" naming.\nIf a user creates a conference with Oregon and Texas as members, NCAA Football must still preserve those teams' rivalry games on the schedule. Building that code takes a ton of work.\nBut even with some leagues' existences in doubt—the Big East, notably, and whatever becomes of the Mountain West and Conference USA—Haumiller can't foresee ever giving users the ability to rename, delete, or change the symbology of existing conferences. Such a feature could diminish or insult a critical licensing partner. Nor would EA Sports Tiburon write code that allows the game to remake its conference alignment by itself between seasons. Allowing users to modify reality is within bounds, Haumiller said, because it's a user imposing his own personal statement upon a product he purchased. AI-driven realignments aren't going to happen, because then it appears to be EA Sports speaking for the NCAA.\nMajor sports video games have had to react, quickly, to real-world developments all year long. A lockout in the NFL, though it ended before the season began, greatly influenced Madden NFL 12's choice of features and emphasis this year. The ongoing lockout in the NBA has pinched NBA 2K12's \"NBA Today\" feature and required 2K Sports to develop contingency plans to reintroduce it, as well as rookies who couldn't be used in the game because of the work stoppage.\nYet even in light of the drastic consequences of a total work stoppage, it's hard to consider a development team facing more last-minute uncertainty than NCAA Football's, and its product ships in nine months.\n\"Every time Joe Schad at ESPN reports this team is moving to",
        "baseline": " this conference, this really means we've got more work to do,\" Haumiller said. \"It's not just the part of your brain that goes, as a college football fan, hey, that's interesting. You're also thinking, alright, gotta write that down and get started on it as soon as possible.\"\nA self-proclaimed traditionalist, and a bowl-system defender, Haumiller seems to enjoy the challenge of assuring that dozens of rivalries, and their carved-in-stone meeting dates, remain intact through the millions of simulated seasons his game serves up each year. It's also a chest-puffing point of pride he and his colleagues can lord over their Madden counterparts, who work in the same office.\n\"Yeah, I don't want to hear anybody from that side of the building bitching about their schedule changes,\" Haumiller laughed. \"They've got 32 teams and set conferences. Get outta here. That's nothin'.\""

I asked Paul Johnson a few weeks ago about what Thomas O'Reilly (a backup center/guard) could do to get more playing time, and I don't remember specifically what he said, but basically he's behind a number of players. I'm not positive about Brigham, but he's never on the injury report, so I'd suspect it's just being down on the depth chart.\nWhat's the story with O'Reilly and Brigham on the OL? Are they injured or have they been beaten out?\nI did read it, though not super closely. I tend to take the viewpoint that ESPN is more aboveboard than many think. It wasn't so long ago, you'll remember, that SEC fans were accusing ESPN of helping Charles Woodson beat Peyton Manning for the Heisman. (well, it was almost 20 years ago, and I guess a network's tides can shift.) I sort of felt like the examples the article used were sort of a reach. I imagine you could find tweets from ESPN's account that paint a different picture. And I'd have to think that if the ESPN's pro-SEC conspiracy were so vast that even the guy (or girl) sending out tweets was in on it, it would have leaked out. They're clearly big on the SEC, but it'd be hard to argue that the SEC hasn't been a big story, or even the big story, in the last six seven years. I'd say that ESPN is maybe pro-big story more than pro-SEC if that makes sense. So I guess this means i'm now also part of the conspiracy.\nKen, You may or may not have read this and I understand you probably won't be able to read it during the mailbag if you haven't already. nonetheless I would like your opinion on the following article www.rollingstone.com And please dont take the \"oh this isnt something I should touch on or know much about\" easy way out. ESPN has propagandized the SEC as truth!\nWill Charles Perkins play this Saturday?\nGood question. If we're talking about true value, as in, who would be most missed, maybe Shawn Green or P.J. Davis? Davis may be the most consistent defensive player thus far. Green has been taking on a lot of double teams, and I think if he weren't playing, it might be a bit more ragged than it is. D.J. White has made two of the biggest plays of the year (interception against Virginia Tech, strip of James Conner last Saturday).\nKen, who strikes you as Tech Defensive player of the year so far? PJ Davis, Isiah Johnson, Nealy, none of the above?\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining me for the Georgia Tech Mailbag (brought to you by Kroger). Looking forward to the discussion. Let's get started.\nMaybe just me, but the fan turnout at the Duke game was disappointing. It was a big game. I also struggle with the D giving up so many points. We don't run a necessarily fast scoring game and the O can put up the points, but the D is giving too much away. The D seems to not be adjusting accordingly to the opponents offense. Thoughts?\nWhy does Roof run such a stripped down, basic, vanilla defense? It's way too easy for teams to shred us apart. Do we really have that much of a lack of talent?\nTech's problem is simple.... they don't attract high end recruits. Say what you want about recruiting rankings/stars not mattering but the fact is a team full of 2 star recruits doesn't have as much talent as one with a bunch of 4 stars. CPJ has gotten very little high end talent on either side of the ball lately. So these results are totally predictable.\nBefore you sign out can you give us a prediction of the score for the Pitt game?\nWhat do you think of Pitt's running game? any chance GT can get a defense ready to slow them down?\nAny feel for what we can expect from Pitt Saturday? I know they run a more conventional offense and have a good RB and WR. Can their QB get the WR the ball, or should we expect a game more in line with last year's?\nI'd think to some degree, but I can't say without reservation. It's one of those subjects that I need to dig into.\nDo you think the defensive struggles since PJ arrived has anything to do with having to practice against Tech's unconventional offense? Seems Tech struggles against traditional offenses (although it also surprisingly struggles against read option teams as well).\nI think what Johnson would say is that that's just the part of him that fans see, that he shows a different side to players during the week. It wasn't Dodd's style, certainly. Johnson did actually win the Bobby Dodd Award, though, when he was at Navy. I think there are other traits he does share with him.\nI was embarrassed as a long-time Tech fan, to see the anger displayed by Coach Johnson at a player who had made a (costly) mistake in the UNC game. At other times I've witnessed him grabbing players by the face guard. Those kind of things should happen, if at all, on the practice field not in a game, especially one that's televised. Needless to say, Johnson will never win the Bobby Dodd Award. I say cut the ties with Johnson and let's move on.\nLet's see if I can do it. those two, WR Anthony Autry, AB Myles Autry, DL Jimmie Kitchen and Darius Commissiong (among others), OT Morgan Bailey and Chase Roberts. there's others, but those guys might be the most significant. Custis would probably have gotten some snaps this week.\nGood question. It's kind of the same. I was expecting Isaiah Johnson, Jamal Golden and Quayshawn Nealy to have made more of an impact. They've had their moments and games where they've stood out, but not quite as consistently as I would have thought.\nKen what in your mind is more disappointing.. the lack of playmakers on the defense or the fact that the few upperclassmen on the D (Isaiah Johnson) haven't stepped up their game.\nI don't know. Paul Johnson said before the end of the season. I'm trying to find out a better answer.\nHow long is Laskey supposed to be out?\nIf memory serves, he needed to earn his associates degree in order to be able to play immediately after junior college, which required him to take on a pretty ambitious course load, and he ended up coming short.\nI don't know the defenses well enough to say. I do know that teams with big, athletic defensive tackles have typically given the defense trouble (I guess Tech's offense would not be alone in that regard) because they can push the center or guard back into the quarterback. Virginia has a very good freshman DT in Andrew Brown. Georgia has a lot of playmakers.\nGiven that he hadn't played football prior to the spring of his junior year, you could also argue he should be much more behind your typical sophomore. i'm not saying let's wait till he's a senior - it's not unreasonable to expect him to make a contribution, but I think everyone's different.\nHe is responsible for Gwinnett, and Tech got three recruits out of the county last year (though one, Myles Autry, didn't show up). He also has Louisiana, a state Tech hasn't recruited much at all under Johnson, and Tech has two commits for the upcoming class (although I don't know if he's 100 percent responsible for either) from there and one from Gwinnett.\nPlus much better ball security.\nIt's strange, isn't it. I don't want to put all the credit on Justin Thomas, but a) he's a playmaker with the ball in his hands b) he's effective at running the option c) his speed and quickness means the line doesn't have to block as long. But I think the line is doing a pretty good job, also. And, as you say, the defenses haven't been great. The closing run is going to be a lot tougher than the first seven games, I think. Pittsburgh, Clemson, UVA and Georgia are all going to bring it, I think.\nAny word, rumor, on why our previous special teams coach departed so quickly. And, I am a #1 CPJ, option fan. Love that type of FB.\nTo follow up on the question regarding CPJ's recruiting and how Tech doesn't seem to get the quality of players other teams in the ACC are able to get, do you think this has more to do with Tech's academics or do you think people are avoiding CPJ's system for more pro style offense?\nKen - are you close with coworker and GSU beat writer Doug Roberson? Wonder if you two converse on the state of the respective programs?\nMany Tech fans, including me, think the officiating was horrendous last Saturday. I know the quote about losers complaining about the refs, etc. Any comment.\nKen - any chance youll do an autograph signing session soon?\nTarheels scare me a bit. They have not played well so as some say they are due. GT also is somewhat like the Braves with rookie pitchers. Make 'em look like CY guys. Do you see the Jackets taking the Duke loss out on the Tarheels?\nUGA and if you believe he can, do you think that GT football (from Mike B down to the fan) should expect more?\nyou mentioned that thins have changed since the O'Leary days? How so? Do you mean academically? If that's the case is it more difficult now to get kids to come to GT than it was 15 year ago?\nSince 2002, 31 college football coaches with winning records have been fired. This number only includes those who were fired for their poor performance (schools who fired their coach because of off the field issues",
        "baseline": " like Joe Paterno were not included). Of those 31 created positions, only nine coaches had a better record than their predecessor.\nThat's right. Only nine times has a coaching change led to a better football season when the \"idiot\" before them had a winning record. For those fans demanding change, I highly doubt that many of them have the patience to wait as the new guy slugs through a losing season. What's worse is that of those nine coaches who did produce a winning record, three of them were named Charlie Weis, Dennis Erickson and Brady Hoke. I don't have to tell what kind of wonders those guys have worked at Notre Dame, Arizona State and currently Michigan.\nthat's a tough one. I don't know. He's played in half the games so far. 3/1?\nGood question. I know Tech is open to it, and the two sides may have talked, but I don't think they've arranged anything yet."

        "prompt": "The old adage, “As goes GM, so goes the nation,” came to life in comments by the General Motors president in 1953, when he persuaded the U.S. Senate he would have no conflict of interest as President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s defense secretary.\nThe adage has held for more than a century — even though GM these days is just a fraction the market value of Apple or Amazon.\nAs always, a recession is coming but we don’t know when. The best guess among economists seems to be mid-2020, though downturns, like nor’easters, tend to creep up the coast in unpredictable ways and sooner not a bad bet.\nThe good news is Connecticut is shielded from swings in the auto industry because we don’t have much of it here, other than retail sales and a schmear of Loctite glue from Henkel Corp. And more broadly, we’re probably not in for a deep recession; we could actually gain on the rest of the nation for a change.\nAs GM positioned it, this cutback of some 14,800 employees and $6 billion in annual spending is due to technology and lifestyle changes, not slumping profits and sales. GM remains reasonably profitable and needs to move toward more electric vehicles, more SUV’s, more self-driving vehicles and far fewer traditional sedans, CEO Mary Barra said Monday, reassuringly.\nSo why are we nervous? First, cutbacks due to technology and lifestyle changes count. And GM posted a 9.8 percent decline in the third quarter in unit sales of cars and trucks in North America — highlighting excess capacity in auto plants across the industry.\nMore ominously for the economy, as wage pressures rise, President Donald Trump’s reckless aluminum and steel tariffs pinch and a squeeze on profit margins tightens, job growth tends to shrivel.\nThat’s what leads to recessions even when the economy seems like it’s humming along. Things looked pretty good in 2006, when GM launched a cutback of some 35,000 jobs, citing out-of-control pension costs. Recall, by 2008 the company was in free-fall and in 2009 it filed the largest-ever bankruptcy for a manufacturer and needed a federal bailout.\nMandel is in the camp that says the next recession won’t hit Connecticut as badly as elsewhere. So is Leo Karl III, the third-generation president of Karl Chevrolet in New Canaan, who heard about the cutbacks at Chevy’s parent along with the rest of us Monday.\nLet’s hope Karl’s “we gave at the office” rationale holds up when the tsunami hits.\nMandel adds that Connecticut’s mix of industries generating growth these days — health care, private education and defense — are slightly more recession-proof than, say, the auto industry or publishing.\nAnd she said, companies in Connecticut have already pared expenses robustly. She added, “Demographic trends are also going to be at play,” as the parade people moving from here to other states could decline or even reverse.\nMandel’s prominent boss, Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi, predicted a recession in the summer of 2020, in an October opinion piece on the CNN website. Two signs: We’re probably below",
        "baseline": " the so-called natural unemployment rate, meaning the job market is overheated; and short-term borrowing rates are dangerously close to long-term rates, meaning the market’s faith in the economy is waning.\nThat should make for a lovely 2020 campaign season. No one should think even in the most optimistic scenario that Connecticut remains unscathed.\nKarl, whose New Canaan dealership has 45 employees, said sales have bounced back in the fall from a somewhat weak summer and he doesn’t see the GM moves as an ominous sign, either. The year will be flat, possibly slightly up in sales compared with 2017, he said.\nIn short, no one should see Monday’s GM news as a big warning. An early sign? Maybe.\nConnecticut is well positioned precisely because we’ve struggled. But two facts are true: GM is cutting thousands of manufacturing jobs to remake itself. And through it all, as GM goes, so goes the nation."

Cassone's research shows that environmental cues, such as eating late, can potentially disrupt that repair cycle and affect overall health.\nResearch has shown that people whose biological clocks are out of sync with their lifestyles — people who work night shifts, for example — have higher rates of some illnesses. People who eat at unusual times have more digestive illnesses than those who eat primarily during daytime hours, when the motility of the gastrointestinal system is at its peak — in other words, when your gut is working the most efficiently.\nEven if someone is used to being up all night, the body isn't prepared to digest full meals at a time when biological cues indicate it should be at rest.

His current research, financed by a $1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, is looking at the relationship between gastrointestinal clocks and aging.\nCassone said researchers know that the body craves higher-fat food later in the day. Even the biologist is occasionally prone to giving in to that late-night pizza craving. But researchers still don't know exactly why, he said.\nUntil then, he said, it's probably best to follow the advice that might have come from your grandma.

        "prompt": "Cathy Glasson: It's time to stop wasting our money on elaborate efforts to deny people care.\nThe caregivers in our union at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) got an ominous letter in the mail late last month. You can see it by scrolling to the bottom of this piece. It ordered them to send documents proving the identity of their spouses and children on the hospital’s health insurance plan. If they fail to do so, their loved ones’ coverage will be cut off.\nThe letter came from an outside consulting firm called HMS, which bills itself as a leader in health care “cost containment.” But this isn’t cost containment, it’s cost shifting. And the irony is that anyone UIHC does kick off its insurance plan may return to the hospital’s emergency room as an uninsured patient unable to pay for care.\nWe don’t want to just single out UIHC for criticism, however. Its self-defeating effort to cut costs is a symptom of the sickness that’s afflicting health care in Iowa and across America.\nRight now, UIHC and all of Iowa’s hospitals are being squeezed in a fiscal vise. Ever since former Gov. Terry Branstad privatized the management of Iowa’s Medicaid system in 2016, the for-profit providers that run it have been refusing to reimburse hospitals for millions of dollars in care. Last year, charity care — care for which hospitals aren’t paid — jumped 17.4 percent.\nNow, under Gov. Kim Reynolds, we’re hearing horrifying stories of Medicaid recipients being denied vital care. In April, the Register reported on a disabled 4-year-old forced to crawl because a private Medicaid provider wouldn’t pay for his walker. The state insists that these cruel cuts have saved Iowans money. But the Iowa Hospital Association says there’s “zero” evidence to support that claim.\nOn the federal level, the progress made under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is being reversed. After its passage in 2010, the number of uninsured Americans dropped to its lowest level in history while the growth in health care costs fell dramatically, according to the New York Times. But now that Republicans are actively sabotaging the ACA, the number of uninsured Americans is rising once again and so are the costs for hospitals that must care for them.\nGiven",

But forcing Americans to jump through even more hoops to get health care isn’t working. The U.S. spends 17.2 percent of our GDP on health care, almost double the rate in the rest of the developed world.\nThe difference between us and them? Virtually every other developed country has embraced a single-payer system that’s far more efficient than ours. Those nations treat health care as a fundamental human right. It’s time to stop wasting our money on elaborate efforts to deny people care. Instead, let’s devote our resources to providing affordable quality care to every American whenever they need it.\nCathy Glasson is a registered nurse and president of SEIU Local 199, which represents 5,000 Iowa healthcare workers and public employees.

Monday, Torrance Superior Court Judge Lois Anderson Smaltz said the girl had told her she wanted to discontinue them.\nThe Los Angeles dance community is watching the machinations closely. Misty won a prestigious Spotlight Award in ballet as the best young dancer in Los Angeles this year despite less than three years of dance experience. The victory caught the attention of professional dance companies, including the famed Joffrey Ballet.\nAfter meeting with attorneys in her chambers for nearly 45 minutes, the judge dismissed DelaCerna's motion for separate restraining orders against dance instructors Patrick and Cynthia Bradley as well as against the Los Angeles attorney who filed the emancipation case on Misty's behalf.\nDelaCerna had filed for the restraining orders because she said the Bradleys, who had taken Misty into their home for more than two years for dance training, had brainwashed her daughter into filing for her legal freedom. She alleged that they had only financial motives in mind.\nMonday's developments appeared to have had little effect on the tense custody standoff.\nSpeaking before more than a dozen news cameras and reporters outside the courthouse following the judge's ruling, DelaCerna's attorney, Gloria Allred, said she expected the Bradleys to honor a sworn promise made in court declarations that they only wanted what was best for Misty and would \"abide by any decision the family makes.\"\n\"After a great deal of thought, Misty's mother has determined that it will be in Misty's best interest not to have any further contact with Cynthia and Patrick Bradley,\" Allred said.\nEarlier, the Bradleys told reporters that they still had a personal management contract with Misty--an agreement signed by the dancer's mother--that gave them exclusive rights to manage her career, as well as a 20% cut of her earnings, minus expenses, until her 18th birthday.\n\"Our contract is still in full bloom,\" Cynthia Bradley said. \"We hope to continue to manage Misty's career and be her teachers.

We are a people on the edge of beyond; on the end of a massive continent. Peoples were migrating northwest; and they couldn't get any further. We have collected them.\"\nHe and his colleagues have found West African, Arabian, south-east Asian and Siberian ancestry in Scotland. \"The West African ancestry mostly originates in the 18th century, so it is almost certainly to do with the slave trade,\" he said.\nDavid Lammy, MP for Tottenham, whose immediate ancestors are from the Caribbean, also revealed at the festival this week that DNA analysis had shown he has Orcadian ancestry – also likely to relate to British involvement in the Atlantic slave trade.\nOne per cent of all Scottish men, said Moffat, have Berber ancestry – why, he says, remains a mystery, though he believes that the penetration of people from the medieval caliphate of Cordoba \"must have been immensely important\". Moffat said his colleagues had also discovered DNA originating from Roman-period Illyria, the area occupied by modern Croatia, which may relate to Roman occupation of lowland Scotland.\nMany of Moffat and Wilson's findings are laid out in their book The Scots: A Genetic Journey.

This new improved food production reduced the period, argued Moffat, that the hunter-gatherer mothers had to devote to breast-feeding, and thus increased their fertility. This led to a population explosion, he said, laying the seeds of a recognisable society in northern Britain. \"It is a revelation. Porridge, and I'm not joking about this, is absolutely crucial to our history.\"\nNot every analysis of DNA has delivered welcome results.

Deaths caused by chronic lower respiratory diseases also dropped 6.5% in that time while those from heart disease fell 5.5% and fatalities from cancer slid 1.6%.\n“Heart disease and cancer together accounted for 49% of deaths in 2006, so improvements in those two causes alone will show big drops in mortality,” she said.

He was 98.\nAs recently as the 1960s, a patient being rushed to the hospital with crushing chest pain would be treated en route only with sirens and sympathy.\nAlarmed by high death rates and encouraged by new technology, a small group of pioneering physicians started equipping ambulances with defibrillators and paramedics who knew how to use them. Although today the idea seems straightforward, it was a radical departure from established protocols and was credited with saving countless lives.\n\"What it all means is that if you have any regard for your health and are over 40, you ought to move to Los Angeles,\" Dr. Walter S. Graf told The Times in 1978. \"Your chances for avoiding sudden death are enhanced.\"\nGraf, a cardiologist who helped establish the modern system of paramedic emergency care, died Oct. 18 at his Los Angeles home, family members said. He was 98.\nGraf was former chief of staff for the Daniel Freeman Hospital. In the 1960s, he established what was thought to be the West Coast's first dedicated coronary care units there and later created the groundbreaking Daniel Freeman Paramedic Training Program. In 1999, it merged with the UCLA Center for Prehospital Care.\nIn 1969, Graf, who was then president of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Heart Assn., converted a white Chevy van into a \"mobile critical care unit.\"\nThe idea was to speed to heart attack calls with a Daniel Freeman nurse and a portable defibrillator. Later, training was expanded to include firefighters and emergency medical technicians — groups that, according to Graf's studies, performed just as well as nurses at saving cardiac patients.\n\"It's easy to take for granted the incredibly elaborate, sophisticated EMS system that we have today, but just 50 years ago, it did not exist,\" Dr. Clayton Kazan, the medical director for the Los Angeles County Fire Department, said in a statement. \"While ambulance transportation existed, virtually no medical care was provided until the patient arrived at the hospital.\"\nGraf's \"Heart Car\" — named for its Heart Emergency Assistance Response Team — helped spark \"a movement that has been responsible for saving innumerable lives worldwide,\" Kazan said.\nIn 2010, Graf and three other physicians were honored by the County of Los Angeles Fire Museum as \"pioneers in paramedicine.\" The others were J. Michael Criley, Eugene Nagel and Leonard Cobb.\nIn interviews, Graf said he was inspired by the work of Irish physician Frank Pantridge, who chronicled his success with emergency care in a British medical journal.\n\"Amazingly, the reaction of the British medical establishment consisted for the most part of disbelief, ridicule and even hostility,\" the Guardian, a British newspaper, noted in its 2005 obituary of Pantridge.\n\"It was to be 16 years before the concept of taking the care to the patient was fully accepted,\" the Guardian wrote. \"The reaction in America was totally different, and the creation of mobile units was both swift and comprehensive.\"\nBorn in New York City on July 15, 1917, Graf grew up in the Bronx, the son of a jewelry designer for high-end stores like Tiffany & Co. He attended the City College of New York.\nWhen his father wound up unemployed in the Depression, Graf sought work for him in San Francisco, where he hoped to go to medical school. Graf found his father a job, asked a dean at City College for his father's $50 bus fare, and hoped for the best.\n\"I put my daddy on the bus and kissed the bus,\" he said in an oral history videotaped for his family this year. \"A few months later, he sent money for us to join him.\"\nGraf received his medical degree from UC San Francisco in 1942.

County. Then he OKd the measure, recalling that his father, Jack Reagan, had died of a heart attack in 1940 when a Los Angeles ambulance was restricted from crossing into Beverly Hills, where he had been stricken.\nGraf's survivors include his wife, Joan; nine children and stepchildren; 19 grandchildren; and 22 great-grandchildren.

These artists are thus officially banned.\nThe list also includes French actor Gerard Depardieu, and even Russian economist Mikhail Khazin. Khazin claims that the gold price has been manipulated downward, and that gold is therefore way undervalued. In 2004, he published a book, The Decline of the Dollar Empire and the End of the Pax Americana.One of the first things that the United States did after its coup that installed the present Ukrainian regime in February 2014 was to ship all or almost all of the Ukrainian central bank’s gold to the U.S. Federal Reserve vault in the Wall Street area.\nThe Ukrainian government has remained silent on the matter, other than to say “there is almost no gold left in the Central Bank vault.” So, this economist, Khazin, isn’t only Russian; he alleges that the 36 tons of gold that was transferred to the United States will some day soar in value. The Ukrainian government isn’t saying that the gold is in NYC only temporarily; they refuse to answer any questions about it, not even whether it left Ukraine at all.\nAs I had reported about the gold matter on 12 July 2014: “Immediately [after the coup], the U.S. received a big payoff from [the coup].

This happened within less than two weeks of the coup. This gold would constitute about $2 billion being paid to the U.S.\nDepardieu said that he felt better about handling the matter this way than if he had taken the more normal path: stashing his money in a foreign tax-haven bank account. According to Britain’s Telegraph, “‘I don’t need to hide,’ he said.” But, as a consequence, his films now won’t be able to be seen in Ukraine.\nYes, we believe in democracy — with elections that are free and fair; and independent judiciaries and opposition parties; civil society and uncensored information so that individuals can make their own choices.

        "prompt": "What Is Zello and How Do You Use It?\nWhen it comes to natural disasters, you never know if traditional forms of communication will fail. Of course, you’ll want to make sure that you and your loved ones are safe, but depending on your cell phone plan, constant texting and calling can get expensive. There are a number of hurricane-tracking apps out there, but Zello has become the app of choice for emergency rescuers.\nZello is a free walkie-talkie app for smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers. The app requires an Internet connection to work properly, whether it’s through Wi-Fi or a mobile data network. Unlike the standard calls you can make on the device of your choice, Zello connects you to fellow users and radio channels where large groups can talk regardless of distance.\nUnfortunately, if you lose internet in an emergency, Zello won’t be of much use. If you need a truly off-the-grid app, goTenna may be a better alternative, since it enables text and GPS while offline. goTenna requires external attachments to work, but on the upside, it's lightweight and weatherproof.\nInstall the Zello app. Open up the App Store or Google Play and install Zello. This shouldn’t take long if you have a reliable connection.\nSign up for an account. If you don’t have an existing Zello account, you’ll need to make one from scratch. The process is quick, only asking for a username, an e-mail address, a password and an optional phone number. You won’t be able to change your username after creating an account, so make sure your spelling is correct.\nAdd contacts. By entering your phone number and e-mail address, Zello can access your address book to connect you to your contacts. If you prefer to add contacts manually, the app has a search function allows you to find users by username, email or phone number. There’s even an integrated QR scanner that allows you add emergency rescue stations as a contact. And, of course, there are unfriending and blocking options if you ever need them.\nTap and hold. To get in touch with your family and friends, all you need to do is select the Contacts field in the main menu. When you’re on the contact page, tap the name of the person you want to reach, and hold microphone button to send a voice message. Pressing this button activates Zello’s walkie talkie, so the person to whom you’re reaching out will receive the message once you release your hold. If your contact isn’t logged in or connected to internet when you send the message, they’ll hear it once they can access the app.\nSend photos. At the top-left hand corner there’s a small camera icon where you can send live photos. In Zello’s camera mode, you can control the level of flash, take a selfie or add text to captured images. If that’s too much trouble, you can access your device’s photo library and send your saved images instead.Forward location and alerts. A triangle shaped toggle at the center of the screen gives you the option of adding participants to the conversation or sending your exact location. Next to the toggle lies a chat bubble icon with a lightning bolt in the center. Selecting this button initiates an alert, which will beep on your contact’s phone until he or she acknowledges it. Track interactions. An icon of an eye at the top right hand corner lets you access an overview of your exchanged messages, allowing replays or exact addresses of your last sent location. You can also monitor your calls through the Recents tab on the main menu.\nConnect to your desired channel. When you’ve selected your channel, tap the circular power icon to join or leave the chat. Intermittent beeps signal when a person from the channel is speaking. The program displays usernames while users speak, so there’s no guesswork over who said what. Users can share photos within the channel, and the eye tool provides tracking and playback options. Unlike conversations with regular contacts, you can share voice messages from the channel to your social media accounts.\nMake your own space. If you wish to create your own channel, all you have to do is hit the Add Channel button and select “Create a channel.” From there, you assign your channel a name, category, display photo, description and an assortment of settings that range from age restrictions to password requirements.\nModerate your channel. After you’ve created a channel, you’re responsible for ensuring that participants adhere to Zello’s community guidelines, which means no bullying or illegal discussions. If your channel grows to a point where you can’t manage on your own, you can assign moderators to help you keep everything in order. You can transfer ownership of your channel at any time, but once you give it away, it’s gone for good.\nTest your audio. When you check your contact list, there will be a Zello account named Echo present. Selecting this contact lets you test your audio levels to ensure voice capturing. An arrow facing the bottom right hand corner measures your connection quality, and your network’s delay in milliseconds.\nAdjust the interface. If the app’s white background is too plain for your tastes, you can switch it for a downloadable theme, such as Camouflage Talk Screen or Classic Talk Screen Dark from the Options tab. You can also adjust Zello’",
        "baseline": "s Push To Talk Button to function with individual taps, rather than holding it down the entire time. The button can also be connected to wireless accessories, such as headsets and radios.\nSet notifications. From the Options tab, you can control how Zello alerts your device.

        "prompt": "In related hydrogen breakthrough news, a team of scientists from Melbourne's Monash University has developed a new fuel cell prototype that could pave the way for a generation of much cheaper, more efficient fuel-cell vehicles. The results of their project, which was led by Maria Forsyth, a professor of materials engineering at the Australian Center of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, are published in the current issue of Science (sub. required).\nThe main obstacle to the mass production of hydrogen fuel cells has always been the high cost of platinum nanoparticles -- the small quantity contained within each cell typically adds $3500 to $4000 to the car's sticker price -- which are used to build the cell's air electrode. The electrode reduces oxygen and is thus a vital component of the fuel cell, helping in energy generation and storage. Aside from its high cost, platinum nanoparticles are also extremely difficult to find and have a nasty tendency to become inactivated by contact with carbon monoxide or by clumping together.\nTo get around these problems,",
        "baseline": " Forsyth and her colleagues used an alternative oxygen reduction catalyst, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), or PEDOT, for short (a type of polymer). Unlike its platinum counterpart, the PEDOT-based electrode did not become inactivated upon being exposed to CO; it was able to run continuously for 1500 hours and demonstrated oxygen conversion rates similar to those of Pt-based electrodes.\nCould cheaper fuel-cell vehicles be on the way?\nNot only did the new electrodes run well, they were also much cheaper to build and were more stable. Forsyth estimates that the cost of a PEDOT-based electrode would only add a few hundred dollars to the price of a fuel-cell vehicle. The scientists next plan on building a fuel cell prototype in 3D to maximize its surface area -- and thus the amount of current it can generate. Another application for the electrode would be in zinc air batteries, which are being used to store energy in vehicles."

        "prompt": "Trump wants to privatize air traffic control. Here’s what that means.\nChange could soon be coming to the skies above America. At least that’s what the Trump administration is hoping for.\nEarlier Monday, President Trump laid out his vision for overhauling the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) — the agency that oversees all aspects of civil aviation. Part of Trump’s vision involves privatizing the agency’s air traffic control (ATC) function. Here’s what you should know about it.\nHow does air traffic control currently work?\nAir traffic services are provided by the FAA. The agency has within its ranks more than 13,000 licensed controllers who are spread across the country at regional control centers. The agency also employs tens of thousands of engineers, technicians and specialists who maintain the technology and infrastructure needed to keep the skies open and safe.\nThe FAA is largely funded by aviation user fees. Taxes are imposed on such things as passenger tickets, air travel miles and jet fuel, with the revenue being deposited into a trust fund. However, the use of these funds must be authorized by Congress as part of the annual appropriations process.\nWhat exactly has Trump proposed?\nWhite House officials say the new entity will be funded entirely by user fees and overseen by representatives from airlines, unions, general aviation and airports among others.\nTrump’s plan is based largely on legislation crafted by Rep. Bill Shuster. The Pennsylvania Republican, who heads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, pushed for privatization last year but his efforts stalled. Presidential backing gives those efforts new life.\nWhat are the main criticisms of the current system?\nThere are several. Some argue that because the FAA gets its funds from Congress, the agency ends up obliging political interests rather than the passengers it is set up to serve. According to the FAA, the budget uncertainty created by this model affects its ability to perform its duties.\nAnother concern is the agency’s organizational structure. In addition to providing air traffic services, the FAA also provides safety oversight for those services. This, some worry, creates an inherent conflict of interest. Advocates of change point to a 2001 International Civil Aviation Organization recommendation that signatory states (including the United States) separate air traffic functions from safety oversight within two years.\nFinally, critics say that government bureaucracy makes it hard to adopt new technologies that benefit the flying public. They suggest a nongovernmental organization would be better positioned to do so, more nimbly cutting through the bureaucratic red tape that has long hindered the FAA.\nWhat are the main criticisms of Trump’s proposal?\nMany Democrats argue that changing the status quo is unnecessary given that flying in the United States is as safe as it’s ever been. They also point to recent computer glitches at major U.S. airlines, questioning whether these carriers can actually handle more advanced technologies.\nCorporate jet pilots also oppose the plan as do their counterparts",
        "baseline": " in general aviation. Both groups worry that user fees levied by a private corporation will drive up the cost of flying. Others argue that privatized governance gives too much control of the nation’s skies to a select few — most notably airline executives — for their own benefit.\nCan this actually be done?\nThe White House certainly hopes so. Privatizing the largest and arguably most complex air traffic system in the world would be a huge political win. But it won’t be easy.\nMany Democrats disagree with the idea of turning over taxpayer funded infrastructure — like control towers, navigation antennas and radar displays — to a private corporations for no charge. Some Republicans wonder whether a private entity can legally impose what may be viewed as taxes on the flying public. Perhaps most importantly, many lawmakers from across the aisle are hesitant to cede regulatory authority — akin to political power — to others.\nAshley Nunes is a research scientist at MIT’s Center for Transportation and Logistics."

        "prompt": "By Savion Glover and Bruce Weber.\nWilliam Morrow & Company. $19.95.\nTap fits uneasily into book form. The dance is all about sound and movement; Gutenberg's descendants sit silent and static. The tap star Savion Glover, in particular, is all about loud: a heel hard enough to break the floor, a shuffle to make you skip a heartbeat.\nBut the book works -- in part because it uses more than language. Sometimes its medium is a written approximation of metal against floor: ''Tickety BLOO kah tickety bloo kah SHUCK.'' Sometimes the noise and the funk come in the many evocative photographs, or the eye-popping graphic design by Paula Kelly, who deserves much of the praise for the book's success.\nThe loose narrative takes readers through Glover's preschool drummer days and the Broadway success of ''Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk,'' which he choreographed and starred in. The story has intrinsic interest, because, as Gregory Hines says in his introduction, Glover is ''the greatest tap-dancer to ever lace up a pair of Capezios or any other tap shoes.'' But the real interest is in Glover's commentary: as he explains what he learned at each stage, his voice is light, straightforward and yet convincing as that of a unique and world-class artist.\nGlover is fluent in tongue as well as foot, able to analyze his own work better than most artists. He gets us inside the creative process, which, for him, seems equal parts muse-sent inspiration and simple logic: brilliant insight and some elbow (or knee) grease. He never seems otherworldly, but his art is impressive nonetheless. Weber writes that ''you count a dozen or more places on his feet that hit the floor and make different sounds: a whole rattletrap full of thwacks, clacks, tippy-tippies, th",
        "baseline": "unks, sweeps, swishes and slams. Plus, he's loud.'' Glover actually describes those places for us -- and, in one of the book's many design pleasures, we get a two-page diagram of a foot with sound locations.\nThese are perfect lessons for young adolescents, who will appreciate the injunction to ''hit,'' and whose parents will appreciate the creative discipline of this rebellion. Glover shows his readers how to bring the noise and the funk with the force of history. The best audience for ''Savion! My Life in Tap'' is probably dancers and those who have loved one of Glover's many projects. But because of what the book tells us about artistic process -- and artistic progress -- it is worthwhile for all.\nA caveat: it will be the precocious 10-year-old who can deal with all the vocabulary words in this book. But it will be the rare 10-year-old who is not inspired to be precocious by Savion Glover's story."

Men rushed wounded children to overcrowded emergency rooms in Sadr City hospitals, on foot because of a ban on all vehicular traffic.

        "prompt": "There is now less than one week to go before the gun goes off to start the Berhamsted Half Marathon and Five Mile Fun Run.\nAt this point in the schedules, there’s not a lot that the runners can do to improve their performance other than taper their training, indulge in a bit of carbo loading and hydration, and get plenty of rest before the big day.\nBut there’s one group that will be gearing up to fever pitch this week, and that is, of course, the organisers: the Rotary Club of Berkhamsted Bulbourne.\nThey have been planning the race down to the minute details for the past eight months, and the days leading up to March 1 are a ‘make or break’ race against time to make sure everything goes off without a hitch.\nThis year’s event will be the 33rd running of the Berkhamsted Half Marathon. The first race, in 1982, was organised by Barry Devereux, a Rotary Club member and a keen runner.\nThe race grew gradually, reaching a total of 270 runners in 2000, and over the past 15 years it has grown more than five-fold, with some 1,500 runners taking part in 2014.\nThis year, with the five mile race doubling as both the Herts Vets County Championships and the Schools Challenge, the Rotary Club could find that every single one of the 1,750 medals are placed around a finisher’s neck.\nWork starts on the event eight months ahead of time, with the Rotary organisers meeting in July each year to begin planning.\nPeter Robertson, who has been involved with the race for 20 years and race director for the last 14 editions, reckons that more than 500 hours are devoted to the process.\nOn top of this, more than 180 volunteers give up their time on race day – ranging from Rotarians and their friends and family, the local Lions Club, friends of the Pepper Foundation and the Hospice of St Francis, and local ATC cadets and officers.\nAnd every year, the race gets better; chief marshal John Simpson points out that this year’s race will have a group warm-up at the start area before the half marathon kicks off.\nThere will also be two extra water stations, a slight improvement to the course which will take the runners down Castle Street, and the option to buy a souvenir race T-shirt for the first time. Brownlow Road will remain closed to traffic, as in the previous two years.\nJohn and Peter both commented on the invaluable contribution of the sponsors, which will total more than 50 this year – including major sponsors SA Law, VAH, On-Site Maintenance, Charmac Ltd and Specialist Building Contractors, Iceni Waters, Elf Ideas, Gil-lec Electrical, Knight Frank, FFEI Ltd and Berkhamsted Sports.\nThe sponsors are vitally important, according to John, as their donations keep administration costs down, thus allowing the Rotary Club to donate more money to charity.\nThe Berkhamsted races have now become a fixture on the race calendar, not just for their optimum scheduling some six weeks before the spring marathon season, but for the impeccable organisation, superb marshalling and the beauty of the wonderful - if hilly - countryside.\nThe event is known for varied weather, from snow to torrential rain to blazing sunshine – part and parcel of an early spring race – and there have also been some major hurdles in recent years.\nPeter remembers how in 2001, the race had to be cancelled due to the Foot and Mouth outbreak, while in 2003, only a few runners showed up after a heavy snowfall. In 2006, he found out that part of the route had been dug up, only one week before race day.\nYet for Peter, the event never fails to bring satisfaction. “It gives me great pleasure every year to help organise the race for the benefit of the local community and runners alike,” he said.\n“The buzz on the day to see all the smiling faces is just fantastic, let alone the end result, when we can help benefit local charities.\n“I have been out in all kinds of weather but in the end we all shine through with the common goal to serve the community.\n> Sussex Sport Photography (SSP) have once again been named official photographers of the Berkhamsted races.\nThis year, like last year,",
        "baseline": " they will be back on site with two photographers, Seb and Sally, who will spend a total of close to 10 hours at the event covering all 1,800 runners from four different vantage points, operating four different cameras.\nIn 2014, SSP took more than 22,000 photos in Berkhamsted, which worked out to an average of over 12 per runner, and after editing, some 19,288 of these went online.\nCompany director Anthony Bliss added that, in addition to the hours that the photographers spend on the course, another 25 hours were spent back at head office cataloguing the race numbers against the photos so they can be found easily online.\nExplaining why the coverage is so thorough, he added; “We have set the business up to reward the photographers to capture the emotion of the moment – the photographers are on commission to do exactly that – it is a win-win for everyone involved, so I hope everyone has a really good run this year”."

        "prompt": "The City collects garbage weekly from 600,000 households along 350 daily routes. The City has long organized garbage collection services on a ward-by-ward basis. The City assigns the laborers and motor truck drivers who collect garbage in individual wards, where they work on truck routes that do not cross ward boundaries.\nHowever, the City’s recycling pickup is organized based on a regional routing system that does not take into account ward boundaries.\nUnder this option, the City would shift its garbage collection to a regional, grid-based system. By comparing the efficiency of recycling collection with garbage collection, we can estimate what efficiencies might be achieved through a regional, grid-based system of garbage collection.\nAccording to the City’s Mobile Asset Tracking system (CMAT), the City currently has 43 recycling trucks. Assuming that these trucks are all continually operational, the City is providing recycling services to 241,000 households every other week using 43 daily routes.36 The table below compares the difference in annual pickups per daily route of garbage collection and recycling.\nThe table shows that recycling collection, which uses regional routing, averages significantly more pickups per route than garbage collection, which uses the ward system.\nThis is despite the fact that recycling trucks only have one laborer assigned, while some garbage trucks have two. However, garbage collection averages nearly 11 tons collected per daily route per day, while recycling collection averages only 4.65 tons per daily route per day.\nBecause garbage collection is collecting significantly more tonnage per route, workers spend less time collecting because the trucks must make more frequent trips to dump their loads.\nIn 2008, the average load dumped at City-owned dumpsites was 6.65 tons. Based on the average tons collected per route per day, garbage collection averages 1.65 loads per day and recycling averages 0.7 loads per day.\nFor simplicity, assume that garbage collection dumps two loads per day and recycling dumps one load per day, and one load in each program is dumped after the 8-hour collection shift is over through the City’s night shuttle program.\nUnder these assumptions, garbage collection is interrupted by one dump during the 8-hour collection shift, while recycling collection is not. Assuming an average dump takes 1.5 hours, garbage is collected an average of 6.5 hours per route per day, while recycling is collected for the full 8-hour collection shift.\nThe table below compares the estimated pickups per hour for garbage and recycling collection and shows that recycling collection using regional routing is more efficient in terms of pickups per hour than garbage collection based on the ward system.\nIf garbage collection averaged the same number of pickups per hour as recycling collection, the number of daily routes could be reduced to 264, or a 24.6% reduction.\nAssuming that a 24.6% reduction in routes would yield a 24.6% reduction in staffing devoted to garbage collection, the table below details the reduction in personnel and associated personnel costs that would be realized.\nThe table shows that if the City were to move to a grid-based routing system for garbage collection and achieve the same efficiency that the regional routing of recycling is currently achieving, the City might reduce its 2010 personnel costs by up to $24.1 million through the elimination of up to 297 positions.\nBecause of contractual increases in personnel costs, the savings from implementing this option would grow in future years.\nThe 2011 and 2012 salaries of Laborers and Motor Truck Drivers will be higher due to collective bargaining agreements, which call for salary increases of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012.\nAssuming that there are no increases in salaries for the other positions and that the furloughs are continued in their current form, the table below shows the increase in compensation costs over the next two years for the 297 eliminated positions.\nIn addition to the savings from a reduction in the number of daily routes, additional savings could be generated by reducing the number of laborers on the remaining routes to one laborer per truck.\nWith 264 daily routes, operating approximately 250 days a year, there are approximately 66,000 annual routes. Assuming that the average sanitation worker works 200 days per year (after holidays, vacation days, and sick and disability leave) to ensure that there would be a sufficient reserve to avoid un-staffed routes, 330 sanitation laborers would be needed to fully staff the 66,000 routes.\nThis would mean an additional reduction in the number of laborers by 122. At an average compensation of $75,579, their total compensation in 2010 would equal $9.2 million.\nThe 2011 and 2012 compensation will be higher due to the Laborers collective bargaining agreement, which calls for a salary increase of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012. Assuming that the furloughs remain in place, the compensation for these 122 positions will cost $9.5 million in 2011 and $9.8 million in 2012.\nThese savings will be slightly reduced because under the current collective bargaining agreement with the Laborers Union, sanitation laborers working on one-laborer garbage trucks are to be paid 9 percent more than their regular hourly rate.\nThus, the reduction in 122 laborers would on average result in 122 additional laborers working on a one-laborer garbage truck, resulting in a 9 percent increase in their salaries. This would cost an additional $856,000 in 2011 and $885,000 in 2012.\nAdditionally, under the agreement between the City and Coalition of Union Public Employees (COUPE) to impose furlough days from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2011, if the City chooses to lay off employees during this period, all laid off employees will be paid for any unpaid holidays or furlough days taken since July 1, 2009.\nThus, if the City were to lay off the 269 total sanitation laborers and 110 motor truck drivers, the affected employees would have to be paid approximately 13.5 percent of their salaries to compensate for unpaid days they have taken over the last year and a half, since the furlough agreement has been in place. This would reduce the savings in 2011 by an additional $3.8 million.\nTherefore, the total estimated savings from switching to regional routing system of garbage collection and reducing the number of laborers on the remaining routes to 1 would be $29.6 million in 2011 and $34.5 million in 2012.\nOf course, there would be additional savings from reducing the City’s fleet of garbage trucks such as savings in future truck purchases, maintenance costs, gas, oil, etc.\nProponents might argue that organizing garbage collection on a ward-by-ward basis is inefficient and wasteful. They would argue that organizing collection by regional grid would reduce the time it takes for workers to get from the ward yard to the routes and routes could be organized to reduce the distance from route to dumpsite.\nThey may also cite an IGO investigation in 2008 that found that garbage collection crews worked, on average, only 75 percent of the work day, indicating that there was not enough work for the collection crews to perform. Additionally, they might cite the fact that Streets and Sanitation decided to organize recycling collection on a regional, grid-based system in order to deliver the service more cheaply.\nOpponents might argue that ward-based system provides better customer service than a more centralized grid system.\nWith ward-by-ward service, City residents have a more direct relationship with the City workers who coordinate garbage collection in their neighborhoods. Some might also argue that garbage collection has long been a primary responsibility of the City’s aldermen and that this has resulted in cleaner streets, timelier pickups, and satisfied residents.\nReduce the Number of Laborers on a Garbage Truck to 1 Savings: $10.3 million in 2011, $12 million in 2012.\nOn some of the City’s garbage trucks, the City assigns two laborers and one motor truck driver.... These employees are responsible for the weekly collection of garbage from 600,000 households along 350 daily routes.\nUntil the last couple of years, the City generally assigned two laborers to each garbage truck. However, due to budget cuts, the City has reduced the number of budgeted sanitation laborers from 816 in 2008 to 599 in 2010. This reduction in laborers means that a significant portion of the 350 daily routes are manned by one laborer.\nUnder this option, the City would further reduce the number of laborers devoted to garbage collection, so that on average one laborer is assigned to each garbage truck.\nWith 350 daily routes, operating approximately 250 days a year, there are approximately 87,500 annual routes. Assuming that the average sanitation worker works 200 days per year (after holidays, vacation days, and sick and disability leave) to ensure that there would be a sufficient reserve to avoid un-staffed routes, 438 sanitation laborers would be needed to fully staff the 87,500 routes.\nThis means that the number of laborers could be reduced by approximately 161.50 At an average compensation of $75,579 their total compensation in 2010 would equal $12.2 million. The 2011 and 2012 compensation will be higher due to the Laborers collective bargaining agreement, which calls for a salary increase of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012. Assuming that the furloughs remain in place, the compensation for these 161 positions will cost $12.6 million in 2011 and $13 million in 2012.\nThese savings will be reduced because under the current collective bargaining agreement with the Laborers Union, sanitation laborers working on one-laborer garbage trucks are to be paid 9 percent more than their regular hourly rate.\nThus, the reduction in 161 laborers would on average result in 161 additional laborers working on a one-laborer garbage truck, resulting in a 9 percent increase in their salaries. This would cost an additional $934,000 in 2011 and $967,000 in 2012.\nFinally, under the agreement between the City and Coalition of Union Public Employees (COUPE) to impose furlough days from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2011, if the City chooses to lay off employees during this period, all laid off employees will be paid for any unpaid holidays or furlough days taken since July 1, 2009.\nThus, if the City were to lay off 161 laborers, the affected laborers would have to be paid approximately 13.5 percent of their salaries to compensate for unpaid days they have taken over the last year and a half, since the furlough agreement has been in place. This would reduce the savings in 2011 by an additional $1.36 million.\nAfter subtracting the reduced savings due to the increased pay for 1-person garbage trucks and the furlough payback provision, the savings from implementing this option would be approximately $10.3 million in 2011 and $12 million in 2012.\nProponents might argue that the City no longer needs two laborers on a garbage truck because the trucks are now semi-automated, meaning garbage carts are lifted and dumped by a mechanism on the back of the trucks.\nThey may also cite an IGO investigation in 2008 that found that garbage collection crews worked, on average, only 75 percent of the work day, indicating that there was not enough work for the collection crews to perform.\nOthers might argue that few cities have three staff assigned to each garbage truck. According to 2008 data from the International City/County Management Association’s (ICMA), among the six jurisdictions with over 500,000 people which submitted data only one (San Antonio) had 3 staff per garbage vehicle, and this is likely because collection is done manually.\nThe other five jurisdictions (Phoenix, Miami-Dade County, Dallas, Austin, and Oklahoma City) all had 1 person per vehicle and automated or semi-automated collection.\nOpponents might argue that reducing the number of laborers to one on all garbage trucks would reduce the quality of collection service in the City. They would argue that reducing the number of laborers could result in less frequent service as it takes trucks longer to perform their routes.\nAdditionally, others might argue that in addition to their collection responsibilities, laborers sweep alleys, pick up trash, or remove street-sweeping signs. Reducing the number of laborers would mean a reduction in these services.\nSimple. Organize the wards on a grid system, rather than gerrymandered as they are now. Makes the garbage collection more efficient, while keeping it in the hands of the aldermen.\nThe trucks on the Far North Side are picking up less garbage than a year ago.\nI know this because while they're leaving the garage on Ravenswood Ave. at the same time every morning, they're coming back for the day way before they used to. Now they return as early as 2 PM, while a year ago it was at 3 PM. All the workers cars are gone by 3 PM now, it used to take until 4 PM last year.\nThe only explanation for the ward by ward system appears to be the very least paragraph which to me seems pretty flimsy. How are the residents' or aldermen's relationships with the city workers stronger if they don't cross ward boundaries on any given day? They still have to pick up their garbage every week? I don't get that at all.\n---I also found it interesting that the city apparently picks up about twice the tonnage of trash than it does recycling. In the superboonies where I live, the ratio is more than twice the opposite. We have two wheeled containers for each house; one for recycling, and a somewhat larger one for trash. We fill the recycling container each week, and the trash container has a few things in the bottom of it; some garbage, contaminated paper not suitable for recycling, used facial tissues, the occasional diaper when the grandchildren come visiting. The city's ratio is possibly a residuum of the blue bag program; people just aren't used to a serious recycling program yet.\nAnd oh yes: the collection trucks have a claw on the side that picks up the container, upends it and dumps it. One man per truck, and he never has to get out.\nCut down on high absenteeism while you're at it.\nI lived in Chicago until 1975 and knew that if you wanted to guarantee that the old loveseat or refrigerator that you hauled out to your alley were to be picked up it was a good idea to meet the garbage truck with maybe a cold six pack in a brown bag or possibly",
        "baseline": " a $5 bill discreetly passed to the driver. Actually, you could give it to any one of the three or four 'workers' who either drove, rode on the back of, or walked along behind, the truck. Since then I've lived in the suburbs (Alsip, Justice, Worth, Lockport) and have enjoyed simple, cost effective trash collection by various private refuse companies. I have never, in more than 35 years, had to call to complain about the service I've received. This includes picking up couchs, freezers, construction waste or trees. If there's a holiday, flood, blizzard or any other form of delay they're there the day after the normal pick-up day, never later. The most amazing part is, all of this is done by one worker, and has been for the last 20 years. So, until somebody in city government grows a pair and finally decides to attack the real problem, this totally wasteful practice will continue."

        "prompt": "German and U.S. nuclear safety specialists say that the solid-fuel, high-temperature pebble-bed nuclear reactor soon to become operational in China may need additional features and an extended startup phase.\nThe HTR-PM is a small modular nuclear reactor being developed in China. It is a high-temperature gas-cooled (HTGR) pebble-bed generation IV reactor partly based on the earlier HTR-10, a 10 MWt prototype pebble bed reactor at Tsinghua University in China.\nWork on the HTR-PM power plant, consisting of two reactors driving a single steam turbine, began in December 2012 at the Shidao Bay Nuclear Power Plant, on the east coast of the body of water that separates China from the Korean peninsula.\nThe power plant is expected to come online later this year and is said to be China's first “Generation IV” reactor to enter service. And while the new design is being touted as safer — researchers in the U.S. and Germany warn this does not eliminate the possibility of a serious accident.\nDiagram extracted from Generation IV roadmap and cleaned up to remove excess grouping.\nThe warning in the form of a commentary published August 23, in the journal Joule, recommends continued research, additional safety measures, and an extended startup phase that would allow for better monitoring.\n\"There is no reason for any kind of panic, but nuclear technology has a risk in any case,\" says first author Rainer Moormann, a nuclear safety researcher based in Germany, Reports Science Daily. \"A realistic understanding of those risks is essential, especially for operators, and so we urge caution and a spirit of scientific inquiry in the operation of HTR-PM.\"\nWhat makes a pebble-bed reactor different?\nThe two HTR-PM units are scaled up versions of the HTR-10 with 250-MWt capacity. The HTR-10 was modeled after the German HTR-MODUL. Like the HTR-MODUL, the HTR-10 is claimed to be fundamentally safer, cheaper and more efficient than other nuclear reactor designs.\nThe HTR-10 has gone through extensive testing and experiments, according to China's Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology and the reactor has an all-around computerized protection system and in-depth defense principles.\nControl room of HTR-10, experimental high temperature gas cooled reactor at Tshinghua University, Beijing (China, June 2004).\nThe newer HTR-PM, like all pebble-bed reactors, has a different reactor core configuration from conventional pressurized water reactors (PWR). The reactor fuel is not packed into rods and arranged in an array surrounded by a liquid coolant.\nIn a pebble-bed reactor, the fuel - which contains uranium enriched to lower degree than conventional nuclear fuel – is packed into spherical particles surrounded by layers of ceramic and the coolant is helium under moderate pressure (around 30 atm).\nThis fuel configuration was originally used in Germany with the HTR-MODUL in the 1960s to breed uranium from thorium fuel. Outlet temperature ranges between 700 and 950 °C (1,300–1,750 °F), compared to 300°C for a PWR, which allows these reactors to generate hydrogen as a byproduct efficiently. This fuel configuration is supposed to make these reactors impervious to meltdowns, even in the event of a total loss of coolant.\n\"Pebble-bed reactors have been described by their supporters as 'free from catastrophes' and 'walk away safe,\" Moormann says. He also claims the soon-to-be-operational HTR-PM has been built without the safeguards that nuclear reactors in operation today are usually equipped with.\nThis means the HTR-PM possibly",
        "baseline": " might not have a high-pressure, leak-tight containment structure to serve as a backup in case of an accidental release of radioactive material. It may not have a redundant active cooling system.\n\"No reactor is immune to accidents. The absence of core meltdown accidents does not mean that a dangerous event is not possible,\" Moormann says. And while Moormann and his co-authors Scott Kemp and Ju Li of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology acknowledged the potential of HTGRs and support further research into them, \"HTGR designs with what's known as a prismatic core seem to be less problematic than the pebble-bed one, so development work should concentrate on that,\" he says.\n\"There was already some controversy about pebble-bed HTGRs, but my impression was that many problems with them were not sufficiently published and thus not known to some of my colleagues,\" says Moormann. \"I hope that the pros and cons will be broadly discussed.\""

        "prompt": "The democratization of data is a real phenomenon, but building a sustainable data democracy means truly giving power to the people. The alternative is just a shift of power from traditional data analysts within IT departments to a new generation of data scientists and app developers. And this seems a lot more like a dictatorship than a democracy — a benevolent dictatorship, but a dictatorship nonetheless.\nThese individuals and companies aren’t entirely bad, of course, and they’re actually necessary. Apps that help predict what we want to read, where we’ll want to go next or what songs we’ll like are certainly cool and even beneficial in their ability to automate and optimize certain aspects of our lives and jobs. In the corporate world, there will always be data experts who are smarter and trained in advanced techniques and who should be called upon to answer the toughest questions or tackle the thorniest problems.\nLast week, for example, Salesforce.com introduced a new feature of its Chatter intra-company social network that categorizes a variety of data sources so employees can easily find the people, documents and other information relevant to topics they’re interested in. As with similarly devised services — LinkedIn’s People You May Know, the gravitational search movement, or any type of service using an interest graph — the new feature’s beauty and utility lie in its abstraction of the underlying semantic algorithms and data processing.\nThe problem, however, comes when we’re forced to rely on these people, features and applications to decide how data can affect our lives or jobs, or what questions we can answer using the troves of data now available to us. In a true data democracy, citizens must be empowered to make use of their own data as they see fit and they must only have to rely apps and experts by choice or when the task really requires an expert hand. At any rate, citizens must be informed enough to have a meaningful voice in bigger decisions about data.\nThe good news is that there’s a whole new breed of startups trying to empower the data citizenry, whatever their role. Companies such as 0xdata, Precog and BigML are trying to make data science more accessible to everyday business users. There are next-generation business intelligence startups such as SiSense, Platfora and ClearStory rethinking how business analytics are done in an area of HTML5 and big data. And then there are companies such as Statwing, Infogram and Datahero (which will be in beta mode soon, by the way) trying to bring data analysis to the unwashed non-data-savvy masses.\nCombined with a growing number of publicly available data sets and data marketplaces, and more ways of collecting every possible kind of data — personal fitness, web analytics, energy consumption, you name it — these self-service tools can provide an invaluable service. In January, I highlighted how a number of them can work by using my own dietary and activity data, as well as publicly available gun-ownership data and even web-page text. But as I explained then, they’re still not always easy for laypeople to use, much less perfect.\nStatwing spells out statistics for laypeople.\nCan Tableau be data’s George Washington?\nThis is why I’m so excited about Tableau’s forthcoming IPO. There are few companies that helped spur the democratization of data over the past few years more than Tableau. It has become the face of the next-generation business intelligence software thanks to its ease of use and focus on appealing visualization, and its free public software has found avid users even among relative data novices like myself. Tableau’s success and vision no doubt inspired a number of the companies I’ve already referenced.\nAssuming it begins its publicly traded life flush with capital, Tableau will not just be financially sound — it will also be in a position to help the burgeoning data democracy evolve into something that can last. More money means being able to develop more features that Tableau can use to bolster sales (and further empower business users with data analysis), which should mean the company can afford to also continually improve its free service and perhaps put premium versions in the hands of more types of more non-corporate professionals for free.\nTableau is already easy (I made this) — but not easy enough.\nThe bottom-up approach has already proven very effective in the worlds of cloud computing, software as a service and open-source software, and I have to assume it’s a win-win situation in analytics, too. Today’s free users will be tomorrow’s paying users once they get skilled enough to want to move onto bigger data sets and better features. But the base products have to be easy enough and useful enough to get started with, or companies will only have a lot of registrations and downloads but very few avid users.\nAnd if Tableau steps ups its game around data democratization, I have to assume it will up the ante for the company’s fellow large analytics vendors and even startups. A race to empower the lower classes on the data ladder would certainly be in stark contrast to the historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite. That’s the kind of revolution I think we all can get behind.\nFeature image courtesy of Shutterstock user Tiago Jorge da Silva Estima.\nGreat article Derrick – appreciating your work on the topic here on GigaOm.\nWe’re seeing wider availability of reasonably priced BI and visualization software tools to help us understand that harnessing all this data is possible – and I think even consumers are beginning to understand the value of all the data, and the ability to make meaning from it. One part of the puzzle that’s missing from what I can see is the education – knowledge transfer of how individuals can use the tools, what good data science methods are, and how data citizens can actively contribute to the larger data analysis community. I see movements like the Open Data/Open Gov folks, and events like the NYC Big Apps hackathon as part of the solution – but as individuals, where do we go to take part? What is the role of an informed, curious citizen in this? More venues exist for learning some of the ‘how’ to make sense of big data as an individual taking a course online, but I’m not seeing a vision from anyone talking about how to connect all of the dots. To make sense of data, we need the tools, the practitioners, the analysis of the problems, but we also need a vision of how all of these will work. If anyone has ideas of who’s got that vision, I’d love to hear it.\nI feel one of the biggest impediments to the democratization of data is access. Most people know what they would like to answer, and how the data needs to be shaped to achieve that, but getting the data to do the actual analysis with can be one of the most difficult aspects.\nThis is a bit of a plug, but we’re working on enabling data access that is easily attainable by everyone. Our platform http://www.quandl.com is a “search engine for data” that is able to fetch time series data from a disparate sets of sources, and provide it in a simple searchable form that allows users to extract, validate, format, merge, graph, and share it however they want.\nBy providing the underlying data for analysis tools like Tableau, Statwing, and many others, we feel we can help to create the tool stack that empowers people to create a sustainable DIY data culture.\nIn every company I’ve worked at, I’ve seen this major divide between IT analysts and Business users. Part of it was cultural, but a major reason was as you point out: “a historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite”. The business user typically was left to use Excel to prepare and analyze data.\nIt took 15+ years, but thanks to new players like Tableau, Spotfire and Qlikview which were sold primarily to the business user and focused on ease of use, the data democratization process has resulted in a power shift to the business user. Some IT departments have now come around and are trying to accommodate these “shadow IT” projects by providing IT support and giving Tableau users limited access to enterprise data stores.\nAs for upping the ante for the traditional players, it has happened already. Over the last two years, the larger vendors have responded with products like",
        "baseline": " Visual Insight (MicroStrategy), Visual Intelligence (SAP), PowerPivot (MicroSoft), JMP (SAS) etc. taking aim at this segment of the market. The Big Data market is still new, but the trend to build user-friendly (or at the very least, SQL-aware) tools on top of Hadoop is also hitting its stride.\nOne good thing coming out of this data democratization is the realization that it has to be supported by a Data Governance effort. Otherwise we’ll see the unfortunate return of a major problem with data democracy: data chaos. Previously it would have meant comparing and reconciling two Excel spreadsheets, now we may end up reconciling the findings from two Tableau workbooks.\nThanks for the comment, and for making a really good point about data governance. Obviously, that’s not too big a concern for personal data use, but competing findings from lots of disparate data sets would be problematic."

        "prompt": "A recent late-night walk with my border collie Zoe has transported me back to one of the darkest, dreariest days of my 30-year journalistic career. Following her gaze down a utility easement east of Bryan Park a half mile south of downtown Bloomington, I saw a young whitetail deer, frozen by our presence, hauntingly backlit by a streetlight half a block to the south. Since then, I have read documents from, and stories about, the Bloomington-Monroe County Deer Task Force, which is poised to recommend that city deer be shot.\nBoth the weather and the mood were cold and dark in Brown County State Park that Saturday nearly two decades ago. The story described the weather as “a steady rain that vacillated between a cold, dank mist and outright deluges.” The roads leading to the park gates were lined with anti- and pro-hunt protesters and counter-protesters when the first shot was fired at 7:32 a.m., two minutes after the hunt began.\nRoughly 100 Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) officials and conservation officers kept the public out until the shooting ended eight-and-a-half hours later.\nThroughout the day, hunters emerged from the hills and valleys with dead whitetails draped over their shoulders. The animals ended up in mountainous piles at check-in stations located throughout the 16,000-acre park. Hunters got to keep one for themselves and donated any others they killed to a food bank to feed the hungry.\nOpponents had challenged the Brown County hunt in court, only to have an Indiana Court of Appeals panel, which included former Monroe Superior Court Judge John G. Baker, unanimously refuse to stop the historic event the day before it occurred. Never before had an animal been intentionally killed in an Indiana state park.\nThe 463 hunters were permitted to kill as many as 1,389 deer that day. Still, despite missing the target by more than a thousand, Indiana Department of Natural Resources officials declared the day a success.\nMy first exposure to urban deer predated by a decade and a half our recent Bryan Park encounters – first east of the park, then inside it and now west of it. In 1995, I read a New York Times Magazine story titled “Rats with hooves” that detailed their migration into major metro areas like Philadelphia. It included tales of deer chowing on urban vegetation, such as gardens and flowers, the same story some Bryan Park neighbors relate today. Spurred by the Times piece, I penned an Aug. 10, 1995, H-T article titled “Southern Indiana again a home where the deer and coyotes roam” that explored how human development patterns and wildlife management have caused deer populations, along with wild turkey and coyote, to explode in rural and urban areas.\nDeer and turkey had been hunted to extinction in Indiana by the late 19th century and were reintroduced in the 1930s, when New Deal-era programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps began reclaiming lands as federal and state forests, parks and wildlife areas. As late as the 1970s, wildlife experts told me, entire townships in Lawrence County were devoid of deer, largely due to poaching. Coyotes had most likely always had a remnant population in the state.\nAs the public lands were managed for wildlife and hunting was controlled, humans occupied the deer’s territories, creating ideal conditions for them to flourish. Farm fields and suburban developments produce an abundance of edge that deer thrive in. As their populations expanded and their natural habitat disappeared, the whitetails followed those edges into cities like Philadelphia and Bloomington.\nAnd the city will remain fertile feeding ground for deer into the foreseeable future.\nIn many areas of Bloomington, especially around Griffy Lake, that capacity has been met and exceeded, deer task force Chair and City Councilman Dave Rollo told the H-T in May.\n“A large amount of the (human) population are being adversely affected by the deer,” he said.\nLike state wildlife officials in the 1990s, the task force explored the use of non-lethal means of control, including birth control, and trapping and relocating them, Rollo said. None were found to be effective or appropriate.\nEchoing the case made for the Brown County hunt, he said the deer have devastated the Griffy Lake undergrowth through overgrazing.\n“Biodiversity has crashed, basically, in areas where deer are grazing,” Rollo said.\nShooting the Bryan Park deer is clearly off the agenda, according to minutes from the task force’s March 21 meeting, the latest available on its website.\n“Bryan Park is very visible, proximate to houses and open, without much tree cover,” the minutes say. But, in addition to the city-owned Griffy Lake Nature Preserve, other public lands are suitable for hunts, including Winslow Woods, Wapehani Mountain Bike Park, Trillium Horticulture Park, Goat Farm and Southeast Park.\nAnd the discussion involves more than just public lands.\nThe task force has considered allowing hunts on private properties of at least five acres. But Rollo told the H-T that no decision had been made.\nThe most likely recommendation, he said, is that the city “cull” the deer herds by creating",
        "baseline": " “clover traps” — fenced-in areas where deer will be lured with food and then shot by sharpshooters.\nThe deer task force will only make recommendations to public officials from city and county governments. Any move to control the animals will be made by them.\nAnd just as it was in 1993, any attempt to hunt deer in Bloomington will be an emotional and controversial undertaking.\nSome will be all for it.\nOthers, while not thrilled by the hunts, will be relieved to see action taken.\nOthers will urge living in harmony with the deer and will blame those who have displaced the deer and created the conditions under which they thrive.\n“When you build a house in a deer’s home, don’t be pissed when the deer invade your home!” another H-T commenter wrote.\nSteven Higgs edits the Bloomington Alternative.

        "prompt": "Last summer, in Granada, an instantly recognisable smell filled my nostrils as I walked past a building that turned out to be a perfumery. Like a cartoon character floating on air, I was drawn inside, my nose trailing the scent that had stopped me in my tracks.\nThe smell was storax, and though I couldn’t have named it, I knew straight away it was the base note of my beloved Chaos, a Donna Karan perfume that was gifted to me one Christmas and discontinued soon after. A complex, prickly, almost medicinal concoction, I’d spent years searching for something similar, but never found anything like it.\nUnfortunately, what I smelled that day was not a perfume, but a home fragrance. I bought it anyway — not to burn, just to have — and every now and then I open the drawer I keep it in, breathe it in, and I’m 22 again.\nWhile I miss the scent, what I miss more is the fact that, for a few short years, it was my scent. I never met another person who wore it, it never failed to arouse people’s curiosity, and anyone who tried it never liked it. Something about Chaos and me just clicked.\nThat’s the wonder of a great perfume. Powerfully evocative, it becomes a fundamental part of who we are, so it’s little wonder the niche fragrance market is booming, as we become ever more discerning about our fragrance choices.\nWhile mass produced perfumes will always dominate, the future of fragrance is far more discreet. For the niche customer, it’s not about the lure of celebrity or satisfying a designer craving with a bottle of Miss Dior, it’s just about good scents; and a new breed of Irish perfumers are making scents that set their wearers apart.\n“It’s an new era,” says Marija Aslimoska, a lifelong perfume obsessive who stocks some of the world’s finest niche fragrances in her shop, Parfumarija, in Dublin’s Westbury Mall.\nA classically trained perfumer who studied in the famed Grasse region of France, when she returned to Dublin, Marija was constantly fielding recommendation requests from friends, often telling them that the world’s best perfumes just weren’t available here.\nSo she decided to change that. Now, she says, the growth of the niche market is reflected in the big brands like Dior and Chanel, all of whom are doing exclusive lines to appeal to the niche customer.\nFive minutes in Parfumarija is all it takes to understand the appeal of going niche. “They’re not packed with ingredients like commercial perfumes,” Marija explains.\nBeyond niche, there is bespoke, and Marija also creates custom scents to order. “People no longer want to smell like everybody else, they want to be individual,” she says.\nA Waters & Wild scent in the making.\nFor Danielle Ryan, founder of Dublin-based lifestyle brand ROADS, perfume is “not just about finding a fragrance you like, but also one that represents the person you are”.\nDanielle felt compelled to add a fragrance strand to the ROADS offering when a theatre project inadvertently led her into the world of perfume.\n“We were looking at introducing scents during the performances to enhance the audience experience,” she says.\nStocked in some of the world’s most luxurious retail outlets, ROADS perfumes — based on concepts like Cloud 9, Flower Mountain and Neon — sit alongside some of the biggest mass-market brands, but Danielle says, “I think there’s space for both.\nSadie Chowen of The Burren Perfumery also points to customer confidence when it comes to the growing market for niche fragrances. “Once people were keen to be associated with a brand, now they have confidence in their own taste,” she says.\nSadie Chowen surrounded by inspriation at the Burren Perfumery.\nCaptivated by the Burren 25 years ago, Sadie bought a cottage there just three months after her first visit, and soon began working at the perfumery. Instantly, she says, “I had a very strong vision for it — I could see exactly what it could be.\nThat’s when I became interested in perfume.” To realise this vision, she undertook four years of perfume training in Paris, and returns every year to refine her skills. Inspired by her heavenly surroundings, she has since created over half a dozen fragrances for The Burren Perfumery, which she now owns and runs.\n“There’s two sides to being a perfumer: the creative side and the scientific side,” she says. “Training is all about building your scent vocabulary; you learn 300 raw materials, which you have to be able to recognise without visual cues. These are your building blocks.\nFar from finding the crowded fragrance market daunting, Sadie says working outside of the mainstream gives The Burren Perfumery “the freedom to follow our own star and create products we like rather than trying to compete with the multinationals or follow market trends.\n“Some of the mass market fragrances are lovely, they’re created by fantastic perfumers,” she says. “But because they spend so much on marketing they can’t afford to have a perfume that doesn’t sell. They stay in a fairly safe bandwidth of what the last top ten perfumes were. We totally disregard that and do our own thing, and that’s quite liberating.\n“The business has been growing every year, and what I’ve seen recently is a keen interest from Irish people in Irish perfume, which is fantastic,” she says.\nLaunched in 2016 by Joan Woods, Waters & Wild is not just Irish, and not just niche, it’s organic; but as Joan found when she went to France to train as",

While Macron expected calm and order be restored, the Chinese-fabricated rumor predicted the opposite.\nMultiple versions of the story were spread via a number of micro-blogging accounts on Weibo and Wechat, quoting sources from a commodity wholesaler in Yiwu—a city well known as a wholesaling center—who stated that their entire stock of yellow vests in stock was sold out and more orders had been coming in from European nations such as Sweden, Prague, Switzerland, etc. The story implied that the “yellow vest” protests were spreading throughout the continent.\n[Yiwu Index] Yiwu’s research report on clothing showed that orders of “yellow vests” from Europe has continued to surge. Manufacturers worked overtime to meet the demand and many traders from overseas e-commerce platforms see the movement as an excellent sales opportunity. Chinese netizens believed that based on the Yiwu commodity index and its big data, the yellow vest movement would spread to Sweden, Czech Republic, Switzerland and Spain. Foreign media outlets pointed out that the Yiwu Index could accurately predict international political trends. Commodity orders from overseas market could serve as indicators of public opinion and hence could accurately predict the results of political events. Back in 2016, based on the orders of election related t-shirts and flags, manufacturers from Yiwu had predicted Donald Trump would win the U.S. presidency five months in advance. Observers say that textile factories in Yiwu have started receiving orders from the U.S and have begun manufacturing flags and T-shirts for Trump supporters for the 2020 presidential election. The demand is now several times larger than orders from supporters of the Democratic Party. Some have started to predict that Trump would be re-elected. This shows the power of China’s big data.\nLocated in Zhejiang Province, Yiwu is the world's biggest small commodities trading hub, and one of the most popular small commodities wholesale markets in China. Yiwu's international trade city has an Index called the Yiwu China commodity index that reflects market trends.\nDuring the US election in 2016, the Yiwu Index became a hot topic on Chinese social media, as discussions about election-related merchandise order records in Yiwu seemed to indicate that Donald Trump was more popular than Hillary Clinton. After the election, even state-affiliated media reported that commodity order records from Yiwu and Alibaba had predictive power, and many Chinese netizens believed that the Yiwu Index was more accurate than the US election polls. Some media observers were quick to point out that this interpretation was problematic, as Clinton, in fact, received more votes than Trump, but this analysis was ignored.\nThis time, state-affiliated media outlet Global Times fact-checked the online story and reported that yellow vests were not out of stock in the trading city and that the sales volume in recent months was not higher than last year's.

They have walked a distinctive path in the world’s commodity markets and established the city’s leading status as the manufacturing hub of world’s daily necessities. Open door and reform policy has helped numerous cities like Yiwu to take courageous steps and strike out for success.

The result is evident in products like Cortana, Skype Translator, and HoloLens -- and those are just a few of the many innovations that are on the way\".\nAnd this attitude was the reason Windows Phone 7 -- arguably Microsoft's first real take on a mobile operating system-- wasn’t released until 2010. By this time, iPhone had showed its dominance in the world, and Google was upping the ante with Android. Windows Phone is still struggling to gain any substantial market share. The mobile platform still has a wide \"app-gap\" problem, though the company seems to have found a couple of ways to fix it.\nBut one of the most exciting things that happened in the company was its decision to open up. Under Nadella, Microsoft finally accepted that it doesn’t have a significant user base in smartphones. The company realized that if it didn't open up to rival platforms, it would miss out on a lot of users. And that’s one of the first things Nadella did after taking the charge of the company. Microsoft launched Office on iOS. Until then Office was only available on Windows, Windows RT, and Windows Phone, and a half-baked mobile version on Android.\nThe move received an overwhelming response from users, resulting in Office apps -- Word, Excel and PowerPoint -- top the app chart in within 24 hours of their release on the platform. Late last year, the company made premium access to the Office suite free on iOS and Android. Office for iOS was in the works at Microsoft for a",

Later this year, Microsoft will release Windows 10 for desktop computers, as well as smartphones, IoT devices and Xbox One. In the coming months, Microsoft will also release the next iteration of its productivity suite, Office 2016. For the first time, the company is simultaneously releasing Office on OS X and Windows.\nAdditionally, Microsoft has showcased a number of products that could change the way we compute and interact with technology. Its augmented reality headset HoloLens is just one example. It will be interesting to see what the company does next and how things work out for it in the coming years."

        "prompt": "Location-based advertising (LBA) and marketing (LBM) could be of great benefit to local merchants, though there are some things that need to happen before widescale adoption of mobile campaigns will come about. Primarily, merchants need to know why mobile campaigns are beneficial to themselves and their target market, how to measure return on investment, and have access to smartphone owners regardless of application, device, or mobile platform.\nFor years, merchants have reached local customers through local daily and weekly print publications and other traditional media channels. However, with the growing number of smartphone users and the decrease of consumer use of print and other traditional media, merchants need another way to reach their target market. In many ways, smartphones and mobile devices such as the Apple iPad are an even better way to reach local customers, offering the ability for short-term, time-sensitive, location-based offers.\nConsider that mobile advertising is expected to be $7B+ market in the next four years, with LBA potentially having a significant slice of that. TheWhereBusiness.com outlined some of the current problems hampering LBA’s growth, with one of the biggest being the relative lack of smartphone users to target. Be sure to take note of their explanation outlining the difference between LBA and LBM. This post, since it focuses only on local merchants, refers to a more general grouping of mobile campaign services, say LBAM (Location-Based Advertising and Marketing), as local merchants are less likely to make a distinction between the two terms.\nSure, there are a growing number of smartphone owners out there, but how many of them are using LBS (Location-Based Services) — aka location-sharing — apps such as Foursquare, MyTown, Gowalla, and dozens of others? There are many reasons people do not use location-sharing apps, including there really being no incentive to, beyond amusement. Why would merchants want to spend money on campaigns with little or no audience? Other issues that limit merchant use of LBAM include the lack of standards for running mobile campaigns, and the means of measuring ROI.\nCreate mobile campaign bellwethers. Applying the “law of least resistance” that humans tend to follow means that the average merchant is not going to adopt LBAM campaigns just because they can. They need to see the value. Someone or some group has to be a bellwether and define standards and metrics, create methods of measurement, define best-practices for mobile campaigns, run some successful campaigns, and then educate and influence anyone who can help propagate these standards. Then and only then will merchants start to buy into LBAM with confidence. When merchants start to make useful offers via mobile devices that appeal to consumers, word of mouth will also help spread the reasons for consumers to use LBS apps. E.g., most merchants know what a loss-leader is, when you offer something at a loss in a sale, in hopes of selling a shopper something at a greater profit margin. If merchants knew how to do that via mobile devices, they and consumers would both benefit.\nAgnostic channels: aggregation of apps and smartphone owners. Merchants want to reach consumers. They don’t care which phone, mobile platform or LBS app a consumer is using. Otherwise there’s just too much fragmentation. App-specificity might be part of Location-Based Marketing, but I think it’s a bad idea from a local merchant point of view. Maybe if LBS apps developers teamed up to follow some open standards, a merchant would not have to create diffferent campaigns for different LBS apps.\nConsolidate ad networks. As with device/ app fragmentation, there’s a similar problem with merchants having to deal with multiple networks. Ideally, merchants should just be able to go",

The less fragmentation of target market that merchants have access to, the sooner they’re likely to adopt LBAM campaigns.\nIt’s not clear whether any of these “necesssities” are likely to happen anytime soon. Several big players, including Google and Apple, have their fingers in the mobile advertising pie and like to define things on their own terms. There are some consolidations of networks and companies going on in the LBA space, which might be ultimately beneficial. On a side note, based on recent patents that have been granted, namely iGroups and Concert Ticketing +, Apple seems to stand the best chance of implementing some powerful LBAM features into their iPhone platform, possibly via the recently announced iAds platform."

According to the company, the classic hip-hop format is safe.\nThe original KDAY at 1580 AM was the station that did the groundwork for the format that eventually landed on 95.5 FM, known at one time as KFOX. The original 1580/KDAY had great success in the late 1970s and early 1980s playing hip-hop and rap music that previously had never made it to commercial radio stations anywhere else.

        "prompt": "I belong to a book club of women who are all moms like me. Once a year we pick a classic to read (or reread). This year’s pick was To Kill a Mockingbird, for which Lee won the 1961 Pulitzer Prize and on Monday received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I had read Harper Lee’s classic in high school and I remembered the plot, but what I did not remember was how magical Lee’s prose was, how connected I felt to Scout Finch, the narrator, and the rhythms of her life in that small Southern town. I wonder now if I forgot all of this or if I never got the chance to feel this connection when I read Mockingbird in English class.\nI was an avid reader even back then, but I often felt disconnected from the books that we read in school. I was reading James Michener’s historical tomes and Robert Heinlein’s fantasy by the time I was in high school (OK, not classic literature, but so fun to read!). The books we were assigned were so boring! It took forever to read one, stopping after every chapter to “do something” with the book: memorize vocabulary lists, hunt for examples of figurative language, and write lengthy essays from teacher prompts. These assignments killed any momentum that might have pulled me through a book, and killed my appreciation for the book, too.\nAs Mockingbird continues, Scout’s views show that she has become increasingly disconnected from the learning she must do at school. She says, “…as I inched sluggishly along the treadmill of the Maycomb County school system, I could not help receiving the impression that I was being cheated out of something. Out of what, I knew not, yet I did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me.” To Kill a Mockingbird was written in 1960 (set in the ‘30s), I was in high school in 1984, and as teachers and parents, we are still bemoaning the lack of engagement that students seem to have in school and with reading. Much research into reading has taken place since 1960, so what has not changed for students?\nI think the mistrust is still there. Teachers do not trust students to take control of their own literacy development or their own learning. We still teach books instead of teaching readers. Students are given very little control of what they read, when they read, and how they are allowed to respond. School reading still seems to be about what teachers think students should be getting out of a book. The opportunity to fall in love with a story is denied to students who have come to view school reading as an obstacle course of comprehension assignments. Teachers are the gatekeepers of knowledge instead of the guides. Should knowledge have a gatekeeper? Until we release some of this control back to our students, they will never become independent thinkers or readers. As for students like Scout and me, who walk into classrooms already readers, we will continue to wonder why our love of reading has no place in school.\nOh, yes. I knew better than Scout. I didn't let on that I could read already in first grade. But I have a vivid memory of my first in-school reading group (and how disappointed I was that there was no reading involved), where the teacher held up a picture of ALICE in a red dress and asked us about how we would know it was ALICE if we saw her on another day, in another dress. I knew I wasn't supposed to notice that ALICE was printed in big letters under her feet.\nI hated sitting in reading group, waiting as one after another had a turn at reading the same page over and over. It did teach me how to \"read ahead\" on the sly--a skill that carried me through many boring classes throughout the years.\nAs a child who read \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" independently at the age of 4 years and 9 months the summer before entering kindergarten, I felt exactly the same way in \"reading\" class. We didn't even have reading groups: the entire class read together. The first person in the first row read the first sentence, then the second person in the first row read the second sentence, and so on to the end of the story. I would read ahead, count up to my sentence, then read something else on the sly until it was my turn. Same for the worksheet -- finish it in about 20 seconds, then read a real book under the desk. I always thought that the other kids, who struggled over decoding their assigned sentences, were BETTER \"students\" than I was, because they were able to play dumb more successfully than I could! That was the lesson I learned by the end of first grade -- school was a gigantic charade, where you were supposed to pretend to learn things you already knew, for some unfathomable grown-ups' reason that kids weren't supposed to understand or question.\nMy mother went to open house when I was in first grade and was surprised to hear my teacher say, \"We have lots of students ALMOST reading!\" My mom told the teacher I really could read already. The teacher suggested that I might have memorized a few books at home, but that I wasn't reading in class. My mom came home asked me why I wasn't reading at school, and I explained that since I knew it was the teacher's job to teach me how, I didn't want to hurt her feelings. My mother told the teacher what I said; I was taken to some little room and given a reading test; I was sent to another classroom for reading every day after that, which made me pretty sure that I'd made the teacher mad--she was sending me away!\nYears later, I was in a staff development session across the table from my first grade teacher. She introduced me to the others as \"so brilliant we had to send her to second grade for reading from the start of the year!\" I never knew the other classroom was a second grade room or that it was a good thing to be sent out.\nI continually wonder what it is we do to children to make them dislike school so much. Analyzing the heck out of a novel, drill and kill with grammar, memorize this and that....No wonder kids are taking mind trips left and right to escape the boredom that surrounds them in school. I hope that more teachers read your blogs and reflect on their own teaching practices thinking how to best engage/invite children into learning again. Children begin school with such excitement. Where does it go?\nLike Kerri, I remember being puzzled by the capstone project for my kindergarten class--a series of prereading exercises bound in a large format book called \"I Am Learning How to Read!\" I'd been reading for quite some time at that point but the teacher was very excited about it, so I went along with her. Luckily, my first grade teacher was excellent at differentiation, even back in the early 70s. I got what I needed from her.\nDonalyn and others like her, from high school reading remediation teachers--Thank you for the love of reading you instill in your students and for helping others to achieve the same with students. When I taught high school remediation classes to help students pass the graduation exams, I had students who had been \"properly schooled\" but did not learn to read for the love of it. When you love it, you comprehend it--that's what I told my students. They couldn't understand why we spent 90% of our time just plain reading books and talking about what we read and only 10% actually practicing test questions. I read with them. We read to each other. They read to me--not round robin reading but the whole class period from a book they loved and wanted to share. It was glorious! Not one of my students failed the reading grad exam after a semester of breaking the \"rules\" and reading without a test or worksheet to assess comprehension! Too many of my senior level students had never read a book even though their classes were assigned books to read and they were tested on what they read. Students too often said they didn't need to read because the teacher spent too much time analyzing the book in class--they just took good notes during that analysis of what the teacher thought they needed to remember. They could pass the test without reading the book. So, thank you Donalyn for what you do with students and for how you have agreed to inspire others to be teachers like you!\nI just found your blog, and loved this entry. I grew up in a small town in Western PA, and remember reading my sister's textbooks when I was in first grade and she was in third--it was glorious then, but third grade was an awful bore.\nIt went on being boring for several years, but then in 6th grade the entire reading class involved just sitting there every day, reading whatever we wanted. Once a week we were to take a break from reading and write a letter in our journals telling the teacher about what we were reading and what was exciting about it. She would write back, too, which made me feel really special.\nFuture classes were never as fun, as we had to stay back to the pace of the slowest reader. I was a vocal kid, and eventually the 7th grade reading teacher finally acknowledged that I had read all of the books on his list of appropriate books...so he had me read War and Peace instead. Writing a book report on that one was hard! After I finally finished it, I talked to my gifted class teacher and talked her and the principal into letting me skip 8th grade reading and go take an extra history class at the high school.\nI ended up transferring to a private school where the other kids had read Shakespeare in 6th grade and I was grateful for my reading speed in attempting to catch up to all that I had missed in my semi-rural public school.\nI'm glad to see so many others who were bored to tears with school. The best thing that ever happened to me in school was in seventh grade. I went to a tiny (60 students) private school. Someone had donated hundreds of books to the school and the headmaster asked me if I'd like to spend a few hours a day sorting them. I never sorted a single book, but I spent hours every day sitting in that \"library\" reading to my heart's content -- biography, history, fiction. That good lady headmaster never said a word about it.\nI honestly do not know how I became a reader. Well maybe I do. But by all accounts I should have been illiterate. I never read growing up. I used to play outside all of the time. Then around 12 years old, my parent's subscription of Newsweek became my weekly read. I would look for it each week and read it from cover to cover. I do not know what prompted me to read and think about everything I read. I needed a lot of mental stimulation - or to think about things, anything, It was kind of odd and I do not understand what that was all about. I then started reading books and I became so immersed in my thoughts about what I would read. I was also too impressionable. At around that same age I read Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World, and became a cynic about life. Then I read Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier (sp?). I discovered my view on that book was completely different than anyone else's understanding of it. I just felt Rebecca was not liberated enough and dysfunctional as was those in her life. Too, later I felt that the book was too single faceted. But I find many authors are that way. I guess I just accept it now and add my own spin to it to make it more interesting.\nWhat is my point???? Darn I lost track. I have a child with dyslexia. Of all things. And boy have I learned a lot about the other side of the reading experience. My question, what can I do? Everything that has ever been said to help these children is ridiculous such as \"they need to practice reading\". Correction: They need to practice ACCURATE reading, not just reading. You cannot give a student with dyslexia a book and tell them to read it over and over so that they get better because all they end up learning is how to read inaccurately. It reinforces multiple mis pronunciations or multiple incorrect decoding of the same word, it becomes an exercise in mind torture and turns them off to reading. These kids need to learn how to accurately decode words. I picked up on the pattern for decoding and it became reliable for ME. Not so for my child. She will need a few more explicit trips to such letter combinations like the trigraph \"que\" and the digraph \"sc\" before she gets it and can do this automatically so it does not interfere with the meaning and therefore pleasure or reinforcement we get in order to have the incentive to read.\n2. Lots of love and nurturing - I stand next to her and respectfully correct the mistakes she makes reading the brownie directions.\n5. Lots and lots of humor- let's face it these kids need to be able forgive themselves for making so many reading mistakes. Humor re energizes and takes away the anxiety that results from all the issues related to not having the most foundational skill needed to feel competent in school.\nSo what may have worked for me -interest and a lot of curiosity, plus the opportunity to pursue reading what I wanted to read, may or not work for these special kids who are often very bright, who are in desperate need for the same intellectual stimulation that we get from reading. The same motivation to learn is there but we need different approaches.\nParent who needs a very special teacher: You are exactly right. Kids with dyslexia need explicit instruction in decoding just like you said. Practice reading incorrectly will only cause frustration. You need to find a teacher trained in multi-sensory direct instruction - Orton-Gillingham. You also need to go to the International Dyslexia Association website- www.interdys.org . They provide a great deal of support and can also refer you to a properly trained instructor in your area. The research has proven what kind of teaching works and the help is out there.\nI'm certainly glad I wasn't part of some of the classrooms described above. I always was allowed to read my own choices; and I abhor stories I hear where children are told they can't read a book because it's not on the list. Ms. Miller and I are of one mind when it comes to getting students to love reading.\nAll is seems to take in my classroom to get students reading is to help them find what they like. I do booktalks on new books all the time, and we have to have a lottery to see who will get to be first to read each one. If we take the time to be interested in students' individual choices and talk to them about their reading, it isn't too difficult to have a reading community in the classroom.\nIf you share your love of books with kids, they will respond, especially when you offer a menu with choices that connect to their own lives. Start with their comfort zone and then nudge them towards more sophisticated, challenging books as the year progresses. I'm amazed at times at what a child will delve into when they're motivated to read something on a topic they love.\nI read all of your articles listed here and I'm so happy to see there are teachers in the upper grades who feel and teach as you do. It's one of the things other teachers in my building just don't get.\nThey cannot resist stuffing their 3 and 4 year olds with information, rather than letting them learn from a rich environment with an experienced guide (the teachers). I don't understand it, and they don't understand me. They say I don't teach. They feel the children will be more ready to succeed if they're drilled in academics, I feel like they are training the majority of the children to hate school.\nLuckily my administrators are more understanding and supportive of my teaching style. What do you say to the teachers though, who like my co workers say, oh you don't teach, you're letting the kids down? Especially when they've had the same training and workshops as I",
        "baseline": " have?\nIn 1962, I moved to a small, rural school where I was so advanced in reading that the teacher said, \" Honey, you can read those books while I have reading groups and the others do their work.\" The shelf was beside my desk. There were plenty of books, like Tom Sawyer, Huckaberry Finn, and others. I read them all and loved it. Keep up the good work.\nThis is what I love about finding a group of really smart people. I can find the answers to questions I need help with. Can one of you wonderfully bright minded individuals please help me?\nIs que a trigraph in the words queen queer query quercetin question or am I dealing with a quadraph with queer and queen?\nI am working on listing letter groupings that represent specific sounds and matching the words to them.\nHowever it looks as though que makes over four sounds such as in unique, quell, queen, quercetin."

He'll spend 16 months studying at the school's campus in Dominica, West Indies, before spending a semester at the Miami campus and being placed at a hospital in the states.\nNamed after a prominent, Civil War African-American doctor, the scholarship covers more than $110,000 for tuition and supplies, according to school spokesman Andrew Serenyi.\nScholarship recipients must demonstrate academic excellence and be nominated by members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. Serenyi said.\nMr. Abrah was nominated by Reps. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., and Elijah E. Cummings, D-Md.\nHe began classes last month.\nMr. Abrah's journey to America, however, began in the '60s, deep in the African bush. It was there that his interest in medicine was first piqued by his father, Yaw Appah.\n\"My father was an herbalist, a traditional medicine man,\" said Mr. Abrah, who joined him in the forest gathering herbs, roots and tree bark, which he would crush into healing rubs or boil to form a medicated brew.\nHe also excelled in school, often ranking first in his class.\nWhen he wasn't studying, Mr. Abrah often accompanied his father at the local Seventh-day Adventist-run hospital, where they would discuss medical matters with the largely American volunteer staff. It was then that the young Mr. Abrah began forming his goal: He, like his father, would be a doctor.\n\"I got some motivation from them,\" he said. \"But you have to start from A before you go to B.\"\nThat meant gathering money to continue his education - no small task for Mr. Abrah, whose father had 16 other children to care for. He eventually became ill and died before his youngest son, Mr. Abrah, was 15.\nSoon Mr. Abrah had to support himself by selling firewood and small animals he caught, earning enough to put himself through primary school. He later worked as a farmer and hospital assistant while taking medical courses at nearby schools.\nHe married Grace Abrahin 1987 and they went on to have three children: Akua, 14, Kwame, 13, and Adwoa, 10.\nThen in 1995 he won a visa lottery and landed in Virginia.\n\"I wanted to go to the University of Ghana, but at that time there was instability of our political system,\" he said, explaining that the school would often be closed for years at a time.\nEventually, word of mouth led him to Anne Arundel Community College, where he",

        "prompt": "Research by an international team led by SLAC and Stanford scientists has uncovered a new, unpredicted behavior in a copper oxide material that becomes superconducting – conducting electricity without any loss – at relatively high temperatures.\nThis new phenomenon – an unforeseen collective motion of electric charges coursing through the material – presents a challenge to scientists seeking to understand its origin and connection with high-temperature superconductivity. Their ultimate goal is to design a superconducting material that works at room temperature.\nThe results are published Oct. 19 in Nature Physics.\nThe researchers used an emerging X-ray technique called resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, or RIXS, to measure how the properties of a copper oxide change as extra electrons are added in a process known as doping. The team used the Swiss Light Source’s RIXS instrument, which currently has the world's highest resolution and can reveal atomic-scale excitations – rapid changes in magnetism, electrical charge and other properties – as they move through the material.\nCopper oxide, a ceramic that normally doesn’t conduct electricity at all, becomes superconducting only when doped with other elements to add or remove electrons and chilled to low temperatures. Intriguingly, the electron-rich version loses its superconductivity when warmed to about 30 degrees above absolute zero (30 kelvins) while the electron-poor one remains superconducting up to 120 kelvins (minus 244 degrees Fahrenheit). One of the goals of the new research is to understand why they behave so differently.\nThe experiments revealed a surprising increase of magnetic energy and the emergence of a new collective excitation in the electron-rich compounds, said Wei-sheng Lee, a SLAC staff scientist and lead author on the Nature Physics paper. “It’s very puzzling that these new electronic phenomena are not seen in the electron-poor material,” he said.\nLee added that it’s unclear whether the new collective excitation is related to the ability of electrons to pair up and effortlessly conduct electricity – the hallmark of superconductivity – or whether it promotes or limits high-temperature superconductivity. Further insight can be provided by additional experiments using next-generation RIXS instruments that will become available in a few years at synchrotron light sources worldwide.\nThis discovery is the latest step in the long and tortuous path toward understanding high-temperature superconductivity.\nScientists have known since the late 1950s why certain metals and simple alloys become superconducting when chilled within a few degrees of absolute zero: Their electrons pair up and ride waves of atomic vibrations that act like a virtual glue to hold the pairs together. Above a certain temperature, however, the glue fails as thermal vibrations increase, the electron pairs split up and superconductivity disappears.\nStarting in 1986, researchers discovered a number of materials that are superconducting at higher temperatures. By understanding and optimizing how these materials work, they hope to develop superconductors that work at room temperature and above.\nUntil recently, the most likely glue holding superconducting electron pairs together at higher temperatures seemed to be strong magnetic excitations created by interactions between electron spins. But a recent theoretical simulation by SLAC and Stanford researchers concluded",
        "baseline": " that these high-energy magnetic interactions are not the sole factor in copper oxide’s high-temperature superconductivity. The new results confirm that prediction, and also complement a 2012 report on the behavior of electron-poor copper oxides by a team that included Lee, Devereaux and several other SLAC/Stanford scientists.\n“Theorists must now incorporate this new ingredient into their explanations of how high-temperature superconductivity works,” said Thorsten Schmitt, leader of the RIXS team at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, who collaborated on the study.\nOther researchers involved in the study were from Columbia University, University of Minnesota, AGH University of Science and Technology in Poland, National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center and National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

        "prompt": "The character of war had changed. Armies had not changed their battlefield tactics in response to new, highly destructive weapons, resulting in massive casualties. Rising calls from British political leaders, the media, and the public demanded action to break the stalemate. British strategists responded by opening a new front in the east with two strategic objectives: drive Turkey out of the war by attacking Constantinople, and open a route to beleaguered ally Russia.3 The decision to open a second front in the east in 1915 ultimately failed to achieve Britain’s strategic objectives during the first full year of World War I. British leaders pursued short-term, politically expedient military objectives in Turkey that were both ancillary to their military expertise and contrary to achieving the overall ends of winning the war by defeating Germany. This article examines the disastrous results of the attempt to open a second front and the disconnect between Allied strategic ends and means.\nWith combat in France and Belgium characterized by hopeless direct assaults on entrenched enemy positions, British strategists began planning for a new direction.4 First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill contemplated amphibious operations in the North Sea to increase pressure on Germany. He proposed a joint Anglo-French amphibious assault along the Belgian coast designed to outflank German positions on the Western Front, liberate the port of Zeebrugge, and prevent Germany from using Zeebrugge and Ostende as submarine bases.5 Ultimately, the British failed to convince the French to participate, effectively scuttling Churchill’s North Sea plan.\nBritish political and military leaders next focused attention on Turkey and the possibility of military operations to seize the Dardanelles,6 attack Constantinople, and open a line of communication to Russia. Secretary of the War Cabinet Maurice Hankey, Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George, and Churchill advocated military operations against Turkey on the Gallipoli Peninsula.7 They agreed that the Ottoman Empire was weak and that “Germany [could] perhaps be struck most effectively, and with the most lasting results on the peace of the world through her allies, and particularly through Turkey.”8 Thus, within weeks of the outbreak of war, British attention turned east.\nAt the end of August 1914, Churchill formally requested that Secretary of State for War Field Marshal Herbert Kitchener organize a group of naval and military officers to plan for the seizure of the Gallipoli Peninsula, “with a view to admitting a British Fleet to the Sea of Marmara” and eventually knocking Turkey out of the war.9 Representatives of the War Office and the Admiralty met and concluded that an attack on the Gallipoli Peninsula was not a militarily feasible operation.10 Director of Military Operations Major General Charles Callwell11 presciently observed that a campaign in Gallipoli was “likely to prove an extremely difficult operation of war.”12 He proffered that an operation in the Dardanelles would require a force of not less than 60,000, with strong siege artillery, echeloned into Turkey in two large waves.13 Kitchener also disagreed with opening a second front, but for different reasons. He was reluctant to divert troops from the continent, which he viewed as the primary focus of effort for the British.\nKitchener further assumed that once news of the arrival of the British fleet reached Constantinople, the entire Turkish army in Thrace would retreat, leaving Turkey to British control.22 Sir Edward Grey, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, argued that once the fleet moved through the Dardanelles, “a coup d’état would occur in Constantinople, whereby Turkey would abandon the Central Powers and join the Entente.”23 All of the foregoing assumptions proved false, and their cumulative effect foreordained the Dardanelles operation to disaster.\nBritish naval forces shelled the forts at the entrance of the Dardanelles on November 1, 1914, well before the formal commencement of the Gallipoli campaign. The purpose of the attack was more to punish Turkey for siding with the Triple Alliance than an attempt to secure the strait. The shelling had a more pernicious effect, alerting the Turkish defenders that a future military operation in the Dardanelles by the British was likely. Mustafa Kamal Attaturk, overall Turkish commander at Gallipoli, and Otto Liman von Sanders, a German general and military advisor to Turkey, focused on fortifying the Dardanelles after the British attack of November 1.24 The Anglo-French naval force attacked the Dardanelles in force on March 18, 1915. The battle initially favored the attackers. Naval bombardment in the days preceding the assault successfully destroyed several Turkish defensive positions at the entrance to the straits.25 By midday, the British fleet neutralized most of the Turkish mines at the mouth of the Dardanelles, leaving nine more mine belts in the approach to Constantinople.26 The Clausewitzian concept of chance in war then emerged. The fleet approached an undetected line of 20 mines, which a Turkish steamer had laid just 10 days earlier.27 Three Allied warships struck mines and sank; a fourth suffered severe damage and was unsalvageable.28 The assumption that the Turks would surrender on sight of the British naval force was incorrect, and the prospect of a collapse of the Ottoman Empire by means of a naval assault alone died on March 18. The setback caused the British War Council to delay further naval action immediately.\nThe council charted a new course and called for landing troops in a beach-hopping campaign from the Aegean to the Sea of Marmara, eventually attacking Constantinople.29 However, 38 days would pass before British commanders were able to embark, transport, and land military forces on the peninsula. In the interim, the enemy seized the initiative. Turkey deployed six divisions, some 500 German advisors, and civilian labor units in a hurried effort to strengthen Gallipoli’s defenses in anticipation of the next round of fighting.\nDespite the perceived importance of the region to British war aims, the Allies withdrew from the peninsula on January 9, 1916, dashing hopes of defeating Turkey and reaching the Russians. British, Australian, New Zealander, and French casualties totaled 130,000, yet the operation achieved none of the goals set by British political leaders.\nThe British experience in the Dardanelles is a cautionary tale that highlights the flaws inherent in a strategy characterized by improperly aligned ends and means.37 The initial plan—a navy-only effort to forcibly enter the Dardanelles, navigate the peninsula while destroying land-based targets with surface fires, and force the capitulation of Constantinople—is perhaps the classic example of imbalanced ends and means in World War I. Naval gunfire in 1915 was generally ineffective against land-based artillery and even static targets without ground-based spotters.38 Although the fleet had limited success in the opening days of the naval operation, decisively defeating Turkish defensive positions in the 35-mile-long strait with naval guns alone was not feasible. Furthermore, ships are by definition incapable of taking land and occupying terrain. In fact, neither Kitchener nor Hamilton had any sustainable plan to seize and hold terrain in March 1915.\nAnother example of mismatched ends and means occurred in the minesweeping phase of the first attack in Gallipoli. The Allied fleet “applied its least capable set of assets, that of fishing trawlers turned minesweepers manned by civilian crews, against the most difficult part of the campaign, that of clearing mines under fire.”39 Even the amphibious landings of April 25 lacked properly balanced ends and means. A total of five British, French, and Commonwealth divisions landed at five separate beaches against entrenched defenders expecting an Allied attack.40 Although the number of forces in action in the Dardanelles consistently grew during the evolution of the operation, the fact remains that the Allies never successfully held a beachhead for an extended period, largely due to the lack of means, that is, ground forces.\nHelmuth von Moltke the Elder, chief of the Prussian General Staff from 1857 to 1887, observed, “Strategy can direct its efforts only toward the highest goal that the available means make practically possible.”45 British means in the Gallipoli campaign did not support British strategy. The imbalance between ends and means in the naval and ground campaigns in the Dardanelles doomed the overall effort to failure.\nDuring the interwar years, military planners and theorists validated the Clausewitzian concept of the value of studying history. Planners and theorists analyzed the reasons for the failure in the Dardanelles and developed doctrine, conducted exercises, and structured forces to overcome the problems associated with successfully assaulting fortified coastal defensive positions. A generation after Gallipoli, the Allies successfully landed tens of thousands of troops on beaches defended by entrenched and well-equipped German and Japanese forces. Allied amphibious operations in North Africa, Europe, and the Pacific were instrumental in the combined effort to defeat Nazism and Japanese imperialism.\nAnother lesson to emerge from Gallipoli, despite failure there, was the importance of the indirect approach, which factored heavily into British strategy during World War II. Churchill favored amphibious operations against Germany in the North Sea in 1914 in an effort to bypass the main line of resistance on the Western Front. Less than three decades later, Churchill opposed the U.S.-favored Operation Roundup, a cross-channel attack planned for mid-1942. The prime minister instead advocated for operations in North Africa, Italy, and the Balkans—presumably softer targets than Adolf Hitler’s Atlantic Wall—before a cross-channel assault against Fortress Europe.\nFinally, Churchill personifies the greatest legacy of the Gallipoli campaign. A primary architect of the Dardanelles disaster, he managed to salvage his reputation and career after Gallipoli, and emerged as one of the most effective war leaders in history during World War II. The lessons of Gallipoli, learned at great cost in blood and materiel, were thus not in vain.\nThis article was published in the Joint Force Quarterly 79 which is published by the National Defense University.\nGermany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy forged the Triple Alliance in May 1882. France, Britain, and Russia formed the Triple Entente in 1907 in an attempt to balance the growing German threat as Berlin’s economy and military grew in the early 20th century. Members of the Triple Alliance were bound to defend each other through force of arms; Triple Entente members had a “moral obligation” to defend each other. A critical event occurred on August 2, 1914, when the Ottoman Empire signed a secret treaty joining the Triple Alliance. See Hew Strachan, ed., The Oxford Illustrated History of the First World War (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 10–11; U.S. Department of State, Catalogue of Treaties: 1814–1918 (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1919), 11; “The Road to War: The Triple Entente,” BBC Schools, available at <www.bbc.co.uk/schools/worldwarone/hq/causes2_01.shtml>.\nStatistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire during the Great War (London: His Majesty’s Printing Office, 1922), 237–252.\nRussia suffered stinging losses soon after the outbreak of hostilities, particularly in the Battle of Tannenberg against Germany.

The entrance is 2.5 miles wide. It extends for 4 miles in a northeasterly direction, widens to a maximum width of 4.5 miles, and then narrows to less than a mile. The narrows extend for 4 miles, then widen again to 3 miles. They continue for another 20 miles before entering the Sea of Marmara.

The historical record is replete with accounts of heroism and suffering on both sides. However, a detailed account of the fighting at the tactical level is not within the scope of this article.\nThe concept of sunk cost applies in the Gallipoli campaign. The theory behind the sunk cost concept is that in a failing endeavor, such as Gallipoli, the decisionmaker justifies continued expenditure in an effort to recoup past losses.\nBritish decisionmaking in the Gallipoli campaign is a classic example of the Rubicon theory of war. Under this theory, “when people believe they have crossed a psychological Rubicon and perceive war to be imminent, they switch from what psychologists call a ‘deliberative’ to an ‘implemental’ mind-set, triggering a number of psychological biases, most notably overconfidence.” This theory helps explain why, even when the commanders realized their central assumptions about Gallipoli were wrong, British political and military leaders made no change in the overall course of the Dardanelles strategy. Information concerning the Rubicon theory of war is from Dominic D.P.

That was the first time in a decade that the total refugee intake from around the world included more Muslims than Christians.\nApart from Christians and Muslims, the denominational breakdown for FY 2018 includes Buddhists (5.2 percent), Hindus (3.1 percent) and Jews (0.5 percent), mostly from Bhutan, Bhutan again, and Russia respectively.\nThe Christian refugees include large contingents of Catholics, Protestants and Pentecostalists from the Democratic Republic of Congo – which alone accounts for almost 39 percent of the total number of refugees resettled in the U.S.\nThere are also sizeable numbers of Baptists from Ukraine, Orthodox Christians from Eritrea, and Christians (no denomination specified) from Burma.\nMuslim refugees comprise 2,016 individuals identified simply as Muslim, with Burma (857) and the DRC (324) accounting for the largest groups; 655 Shi’ites, including 504 from Afghanistan; and 486 Sunnis, with Afghans again making up the largest number (226).\nThe U.S. has also admitted 173 Ahmadiyya – all from Pakistan, a country whose constitution does not recognize Ahmadis as Muslims, and whose penal code criminalizes Ahmadi worship.\nIn recent years the makeup of Syrian refugees in particular became a sensitive issue, both because of overall security concerns but also because so few of those admitted were Christians.\nThat was the case despite the Obama administration’s determination in 2016 that ISIS’ atrocities against Christians, Yazidis and other religious minorities in areas under its control amounted to genocide.\nThe disparity was especially stark in FY 2016, when of a total of 12,587 Syrian refugees admitted – accounting for 1.8 percent of all refugees admitted that year – 12,486 (99.2 percent) were Muslims and 68 (0.5 percent) were Christians, including Orthodox, Greek Orthodox and Catholic.\nAlthough Muslims do significantly outnumber Christians in Syria, the Christian minority nonetheless made up around 10 percent of the total population when the civil war began in 2011.\nIn FY 2017, the U.S. resettled 6,549 Syrian refugees, or 12.2 percent of all refugees admitted that year. Of those Syrians, 6,405 (97.8 percent) were Muslims and 113 (1.7 percent) were Christians.\nIn FY 2018, however, of 60 Syrian refugees admitted – just 0.27",

Since 1980, the lowest number of refugees admitted until now was 27,131, in FY 2002.\nThe Trump administration this week proposed a refugee admission cap of 30,000 for FY 2019, the lowest since the legislation was enacted in 1980.

As against the policy that attracted fresh investments in ginning, spinning and garmenting, the assistance scheme covers segments such as weaving, knitting, dyeing/printing, machine carpeting, technical textile, composite units and other activities in the textile value chain such as embroidery, winding, sizing, twisting and crimping.\nThe scheme provides financial assistance through credit-linked interest subsidy of six per cent for micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and 4-6 per cent for large enterprises, with an upper ceiling of Rs 20 crore per annum. Further, the scheme offers subsidy in power tariff of up to Rs 3 per unit for weaving, and Rs 2 per unit for other eligible segments with a validity of five years.\n“The assistance scheme for textile value chain is meant for new units being set up in Gujarat. However, there is nothing for the existing scheme. On the basis of the subsidy, the newer units would be more cost-effective, and compete with us on price difference. Already, the existing textile industry in Gujarat is struggling because of multiple reasons. Hence, we are going to ask the state government for some relief against the new scheme,” said Jitu Vakharia, president of South Gujarat Textile Processors’ Association (SGTPA).\nAlready, around 30 textile processing units have been shut in recent months, with the remaining 320 odd units functioning at only 70 per cent of the original capacity. Surat, the biggest textile market in the state, alone has seen daily production fall from 40 million metre per day to 25 million metre per day.\nAccording to industry sources, based on the subsidy under the new scheme, newer units could carry a 15-20 per cent production cost advantage over the existing ones.\n“Any such policy is for new investment, but this aggravates the scenario for the existing units. Earlier, we were facing competition from outside, but now the competition will be closer home. It is only now that the industry is reviving in terms of growing demand in the last fortnight or so. The move",

The benefits can be availed once in two years during the operative period of the scheme.\nFurther, a one-time financial assistance of up to 50 per cent of cost, with a limit of Rs 25 lakh, is provided for technology upgrade and modernisation in textile value chain. The scheme provides assistance of up to 25 per cent of capital expenditure on common facilities and infrastructure, with a limit of Rs 15 crore for setting up textile parks."

        "prompt": "It's not always easy to keep mentally focused during running. Focus requires discipline and a certain level of mental toughness, meaning that you have developed the capacity to perform to the best of your ability despite external conditions or internal distractions. You can minimize distractions and help yourself stay focused by implementing self-help techniques and maintaining a positive, nonjudgmental attitude.\nMentally tough athletes push through and overcome obstacles to stay focused on their ultimate goal. Developing the traits that characterize mental toughness can help you remain focused during running. According to sports psychologist JoAnn Dahlkoetter in an article for the online runner's resource, \"Competitor,\" several characteristics or traits tare commonly identified in mentally tough runners: Resilience, focus, strength, preparation, vision, openness and trust. You simply do not allow yourself to become distracted by external conditions or internal emotions -- you have the ability to put these distractions behind you for the time being and live in the moment.\nPositive self-talk can encourage you and help you stay focused while running. According to sports psychologists Leif Smith and Todd Kays in \"Sports Psychology for Dummies,\" mentally repeating specific cue words, such as \"focus\" or \"hustle,\" may help to increase your concentration when you feel a decrease in your level of focus. Tape the cue words to a piece of athletic tape around your wrist and mentally concentrate on them while you run, as though the words are your mantra. Don't beat yourself up if you're having an off day. Talk to yourself as you would talk to a good friend. Be positive and encouraging and tell yourself that you can do it.\nWhen you feel yourself starting to tire or slow down, marathon runner and trainer Jeff Galloway suggests practicing the following drill, adapted from his book, \"Mental Training for Runners: How to Stay Motivated.\" Tell yourself that you're going to continue running for just",

If you break down your goal into small chunks, it may seem more manageable and achievable and you'll be less likely to lose focus.\nAlmost all athletes use some form of visualization prior to or during their workout or competition to help them stay focused. According to Galloway, worrying and focusing on the negative possibilities is a major way that many runners become distracted and lose motivation. Visualization can help you overcome your worries and direct your focus back to your goal. Visualization involves vividly imagining and rehearsing positive outcomes to future events or the event in which you're currently involved. Before your race, you might lie down and imagine yourself running effortlessly, overcoming obstacles and achieving your goal. The more vividly you can imagine the scene by involving all of your five senses, the more effective your visualization will be."

        "prompt": "The controversial $3 billion corporate tax initiative Measure 97 went down in defeat, according to partial election returns Tuesday night.\nMeasure 97 was failing 58 percent to 42 percent as of 9:50 p.m.\nThe defeat follows a hard-fought campaign that broke Oregon's spending record for ballot initiatives and pitted business interests against the state's largest public employee unions.\nMeasure 97 would charge certain C corporations a 2.5 percent tax on their gross annual sales in Oregon above $25 million. The measure called for the state to spend the new revenue on education, health care and senior services.\nSupporters of Measure 97 were still figuring out how to respond Tuesday night. Ben Unger, executive director of the union-affiliated group Our Oregon which backed the measure, suggested a different tax proposal might have fared better with voters. \"Clearly, we learned the tonight that the details weren't right,\" Unger said. However, when a reporter asked if the tax rate proposed in Measure 97 was too high, Unger said \"I would be surprised if you talked to very many voters that found that that was the problem.\"\nPat McCormick, a spokesman for the campaign to defeat the tax, said Measure 97 \"fell of its own weight when people understood what it would do\" and now it's up to state officials to come up with proposals to balance the state budget. \"The business community does have members that are very much committed to finding routes to go forward,\" McCormick said.\nState economists in the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office estimated the tax would raise at least $6 billion for every two-year spending cycle, a 33 percent increase in tax revenue going to the state's current $18 billion general fund budget. That would have been the largest tax increase in Oregon's history, at least by dollar amount, according to Legislative Revenue Officer Paul Warner.\nThose potential tax hits -- and the promise of new revenue for government services -- spurred businesses and public employee unions to the highest level of campaign spending in Oregon history.\nAs of Friday, opponents reported raising $25.9 million, while supporters reported $16.4 million. The previous record for the costliest Oregon campaign was set in 2014, when opponents of a measure to label genetically modified foods spent nearly $21 million with supporters spending $8 million.\nMeasure 97 started out with 60 percent support in a poll taken a year ago. A poll in September found the same level of support. But by mid-October it had eroded down to 46 percent and by the end of the month only 40 percent of respondents to one poll said they'd vote for it.\nThe central debate throughout the campaign was whether corporations or consumers would end up paying the cost of the tax -- and how much.\nA study by economists in the Legislative Revenue Office found businesses would pass on part of the tax in the form of higher prices, and a typical Oregon family might wind up paying $600 a year. Grocery stores and other low-margin businesses said they would be forced to raise prices, because the 2.5 percent tax would obliterate their slim profit margins.\nSupporters of the measure said no economic modeling -- including in a study they funded, by Portland State University economists -- could accurately estimate the",
        "baseline": " impact of the measure.\nThe backers argued it was too different from gross receipts taxes in other states. And they offered state-by-state shopping comparisons to show that different tax rates didn't result in different prices.\nBut Measure 97 opponents also pointed to a written opinion from a lawyer for the Legislature that said lawmakers could spend the revenue as they wanted simply by passing budget bills, despite language in the measure calling for the money to be spent on early childhood and K-12 education, health care and services for seniors.\nGov. Kate Brown, lawmakers, public employee unions and the business community now face the challenge of coming together after the bruising battle to address the state's ongoing challenges.\nVoters' rejection of Measure 97 means the governor and lawmakers must now pass a tax increase, budget cuts or some combination to fill a projected $1.35 billion budget shortfall in the next two-year budget. That estimate was based on the amount of money needed to preserve existing services and programs."

LOUIS – The question has been asked so many times over the past 16 months of this presidential election that it has become a cliche: Has anyone ever seen anything quite like this? And yet, once again, Donald Trump took Campaign 2016 to places no one could have imagined when it all began.\nIn the wake of the release of an 11-year-old video of Trump speaking of actions that, if carried out, would amount to sexual assaults of women, the Republican nominee may have stepped back, issued another apology and tried to keep his demeanor in his exchange with Hillary Clinton as restrained as possible. He chose to do otherwise.\nIt’s not that serious issues were not addressed and at times serious disagreements aired, whether it was over the Affordable Care Act or the state of U.S. foreign policy under President Barack Obama. But never has there been a debate in which the attacks, the body language or the exchanges conveyed the degree to which this campaign has reached the depths of division and disagreement, not just between the two candidates but between two Americans.\nMost of the fireworks took place in the first half of the debate. By the second half, the personal insults receded slightly and it was during these exchanges that Trump sought to press his case that Clinton is a symbol of a failed status quo and that he offers not only alternate policies but also would blow up that status quo with an entirely different style of leadership.\nThose are the arguments that Trump hopes will motivate enough fed-up voters to give him the presidency. They also could make some Republican leaders think twice before they leave him. If he accomplished that, then the night can be counted as partially successful for him.\nThat means it won’t just be reaction to Trump’s performance in the debate that will affect the campaign coming days. Voters will continue to draw their conclusions about his fitness to serve as president apart from how he looked and sounded on the stage here in St. Louis. And while a rebound is possible, further slippage, or even status quo, could prove political fatal, given the precarious state of his candidacy.\nMeanwhile, Republican elected officials will make their own assessments of his and the party’s future in the context of the lewd video -and everything else they have endured from Trump both before and since he became their presidential nominee.",

Their goal will be to protect their majorities in the House and the Senate. But their efforts are likely to intensify a growing civil war within the GOP – as the hostile reaction by Trump loyalists to some of those who split with him underscored.\nThe final presidential debate won’t come for more than a week – Oct. 19 in Las Vegas. But its significance could pale in comparison to what happens in the days immediately ahead. Events are moving far too quickly and the stakes – for Trump personally and for the Republican Party – far too large for anyone to wait.\nPublished: Oct. 9, 2016, 8:57 p.m."

        "prompt": "In the real world, as opposed to the imaginary universe that neoconservatives and Wilsonians dream about, there are very few really good protagonists or really bad antagonists.\nA former Turkish diplomat told me that during a visit to the Pentagon after 9/11, a top official explained that the Bush Administration hoped Ankara would take steps towards strengthening political and military ties with New Delhi, as part of a process that could lead eventually to the establishment of an alliance between the three pro-Western democracies of India, Turkey and Israel.\nThe Turkish official was dumbfounded. Where was his counterpart getting his political intelligence from? After all, it wasn’t a secret that when it came to the conflict between India and Pakistan, Turkey tended to identify and cooperate with the South Asian Muslim country.\nNo to mention the fact that notwithstanding the partnership between Ankara and Jerusalem, the Turks never considered Israel to be an “ally,” as they attempted balancing their relationship with the Jewish State and the Arab countries. In fact, Israel and Turkey didn’t establish full diplomatic until 1992 following the Oslo Process that led to the rapprochement between the Israelis and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nAnd in any case, the idea of Turkey siding with India and challenging the balance of power in South Asia didn’t make a lot of sense, particularly at a moment when the United States as part of its campaign against terrorism was strengthening its ties with Islamabad and elevating them to the status of a strategic alliance.\nBut then it seemed that Pentagon official was engaged in one of the intellectual exercises favored by both neoconservatives on the political right and liberal internationalists on the political left: Drawing up foreign policy narratives that reflect the dualistic cosmology of Manichaeism in which international relations is seen as a never-ending struggle between light and darkness, between the forces of good led by the United States that are confronting the bad guys, ranging from “rogue states” to “authoritarian regimes” that threaten to destroy the liberal international order.\nBut in the real world, as opposed to the imaginary universe that neoconservatives and Wilsonians dream about, there are very few really good protagonists or really bad antagonists.\nSo you need to make sure that while constructing a narrative one takes into account the “anomalies” and resolve the cognitive dissonance between the plot of the fairy tale and the many shades of gray that typify the relations between nations.\nHence, when the Bush Administration responded to the attacks on New York and Washington by Al Qaeda, the radical Muslim fundamentalist group, by launching the war against terrorism it identified Iraq and Iran as two of the leading members of the Axis of Evil it was planning to confront.\nBut that proposed narrative was full with inconsistencies. The secular Ba’ath regime in Baghdad and the Shiite clerics in Tehran regarded Osama Bin Ladin’s terrorist group as well as its ally, the Taliban, the Sunni Muslim fundamentalist movement ruling Afghanistan as ideological adversaries (in the case of the secular and semi-fascist Saddam Hussein) or as sectarian foes (in the case of Iran’s Ayatollahs).\nOn the other hand, two of Washington’s allies in the war on terrorism, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, were the two main allies of the Taliban while Al Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden were proponents of the extremist Wahhabi Muslim dogma promoted by the Saudis and embraced by the Pakistanis.\nThe neocons that championed the Bush Administration’s move to oust Saddam Hussein and invade Iraq were never able to resolve this dissonance. They tried to protect it by turning “Islamo-Fascism” into the an all encompassing bogeyman that seemed to cover all the bad guys – Saddam and the Ayatollahs; Al Qaeda and Hizbolah; the Taliban and Hamas– while not dwelling on the role of that the Saudis and the Pakistan had played in the story.\nThey even provided the narrative with a Happy End – the ushering of the age of liberal democracy in the Middle East though the use of American military power. That the story ended with a stronger Iran, the rise of Islamic State (IS), and the return of the Taliban: well that would have to wait for another narrative.\nSo perhaps it’s not surprising that the same cast of narrative writers in Washington who were responsible for that foreign policy flop, are now trying to employ their creative talents to come-up with new story lines that would help convince us that once again the international system was dominated by a struggle between the forces of light and the forces of darkness. And guess which side we are on?\nFor a while it seemed as though the reality of international relations was anything but Manichean, with the Middle East degenerating into a struggle over power between a few allies (Turkey; the Kurds; Israel); not very-nice players who happen to be our friends (Saudi Arabia; Egypt); the bad ones (Iran; Syria; Hizbolah; Hamas), and the devil incarnate (IS) that happened to be a killing machine that owes its radical Islamist ideology to the Wahhabi teachers in Saudi Arabia. Not to mention Al Qaeda and its many political satellites that were located now somewhere between the bad ones and the devil incarnate.\nThat was kind of a bummer, if you plan to write a script for a western in which the noble protagonists fight the evil antagonists, as opposed to a post-modern David Lynch movie with its tormenting moral ambiguity, which unfortunately is how the international system looks quite frequently.\nRussia’s military intervention in Ukraine in 2014 and West was encouraging in a sense that it helped to cast Vladimir Putin as the new global villain. That Putin strengthened Russia’s ties with its old client state Syria and maintained friendly ties with Iran, allowed the creative juices of the narrative writers to start flowing again and to identify the new forces of darkness: The authoritarian Putin; the murderous Bashar Assad; and the Ayatollahs in Tehran.\nNever mind that the secular Assad and for that matter, Iran, were fighting the IS and other radical Sunni Islamist groups. Or that Russia had to protect legitimate strategic interests in the Middle East and was strengthening its ties with a U.S. ally, Israel. Or that Turkey was at one point allied with Assad, that it was an adversary of the Kurds and in the midst of a major diplomatic confrontation with Israel, and that together with the Saudis, Ankara helped support radical Sunni Islamist groups.\nIndeed, it was becoming more and more difficult to cast Turkey’s Recap Tayyip Erdogan, who like Putin was accused of projecting authoritarian tendencies, as the good guy in the evolving narrative, especially after the Turks shot-down a Russian warplane on its border with Syria in November 2015, raising the specter of a war between the Russians and the Turks.\nBut not to worry: Amid the tensions between Ankara and the West in the aftermath of the attempted military coup in Turkey, and as the two countries struggled with their flagging economies, Moscow and Ankara decided to patch their relations, leading to a meeting between Erdogan and Putin in Moscow.\nJudging by the reaction of the foreign policy crowd in Washington, the meeting was nothing short of an historic summit, a turning point in the Middle East politics that could reshape the global balance of balance: The supposedly two anti-Eastern authoritarian leaders, are cooperating with the other force of darkness, Iran, in shoring up Assad brutal regime and check mating the United States.\nIt almost goes without saying that this storyline is farfetched when one takes into consideration that Turkey is an",
        "baseline": " important member of NATO and is seeking membership in the European Union (EU). Just count how many times President Barack Obama has met with Erdogan. And Turkey (like in the case of Russia), continues to hold free and democratic elections (certainly more open than those held in “liberated” Iraq or in Egypt).\nThere is no question that there are serious disagreements between the U.S. and Turkey – as there are between Russia and Turkey or between the Russia and the United States -- over the strategy of bringing an end to the civil war in Syria as well as over Kurdish issue. But those disagreements would not necessarily disappear if a more secular and liberal government had led Turkey.\nOn one level, scripting Manichean foreign policy narratives is at best an intriguing intellectual exercise. But at worst, it can impact the foreign policy discourse in Washington; in the way the neoconservative narrative helped shape public perception of policy after 9/11, creating the conditions for the decision to invade Iraq."

Recent comments by none other than SNL alumni Jimmy Fallon may be another indication of gaming's mainstream acceptance, as he sounds ready to add gaming coverage to his upcoming stint on Late Night.\n\"We're going to treat a video game premiere as if it was a movie premiere,\" Fallon told Canada.com, when talking about his plans for after he takes over for Conan O'Brian. \"My generation grew up with the computer. We grew up with the Internet. We live in a video game type of world—video games are second nature to us. Games make more money, as an industry, than the film industry.\" Are games about to be treated just as well—or as poorly—as the newest action film on the late-night talk circuit?\nWhile the above quote may be sending the gaming blogs into states of ecstasy, it's important to note that so far these are just words; tonight is Fallon's first night on the job. It's unclear whether the producers will see gaming as a path to ratings, although the possibilities are certainly there.\nThe situation isn't hopeless, though, as gaming does have its camera-ready personalities. Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Mario, is an unassuming but funny presence... although the language barrier could be tricky to overcome.\nCliff Bleszinski is another natural choice, as his personality already seems a little large for the gaming world. Peter Moore is a more assured, low-key sort, but he's forceful, and EA Sports titles are a good draw. Kelly Zmak from Radical Entertainment could certainly sell a game on late night television, to bring up someone who may not be a household name. While few outside the gaming press may know who he is in the US, Alex Verrey from Mad Catz is an effusive, almost criminally enthusiastic guy, and his history as \"Big Boy Barry,\" a television presenter focusing on games in the UK, makes him a natural.\nThere are many people, both well-known and obscure in the gaming world, who could easily hold the spotlight in that sort of setting; the list above",

It would be worth finding out.\nIf nothing else, this one quote has given the show a ton of buzz in the tech and gaming enthusiast press. We don't know whether it will amount to much, but if Fallon does decide to use his show to take games one more step towards receiving the same treatment as movies, music, or even books on television, it could be a way to further his credentials in the tech world. Fallon already boasts over 170,000 followers on Twitter, and news about Late Night often comes through his updates.

In this White House ceremony, President Obama noted it took more than four decades to bring the organizer of the murders, Edgar Ray Killen, to justice.\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: On June 21st, 1964, three young men—two white and one black—set out to learn more about the burning of a church in Neshoba County, Mississippi: James Earl Chaney, 21 years old; Andrew Goodman, 20 years old; Michael Henry Schwerner, 24 years old—young men.

        "prompt": "\"It's not me, it's my hormones\" is not just a lame excuse - millions of apparently healthy Britons suffer from hormonal disorders that wreak havoc with their health.\n\"We are seeing more people diagnosed with hormonal complaints than ever before,\" says John Monson, Emeritus Professor of Clinical Endocrinology St Bart's Hospital, London, and consultant physician at The London Clinic.\nThe rise in numbers is partly because diagnostic techniques have improved, but the stress of modern life and poor diet may be contributory factors. Most sufferers of glandular disorders are women, although it's not clear why.\nSYMPTOMS: Irregular or absent periods, reduced fertility or recurrent miscarriage, excessive bodily and facial hair, thinning hair on the scalp, rapid weight gain and a difficulty in losing weight, depression, mood swings, oily skin and acne.\nCAUSES: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects around 8 per cent of premenopausal women. It is caused by the ovaries producing irregular amounts of various hormones, including the follicle-stimulating hormone (too little prevents a woman from ovulating, causing infertility). Many women with this condition are also resistant to insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar - and, as a result, they also have too much of the male hormones such as testosterone. Another problem is ovarian cysts.\nTREATMENT: The drug metformin can improve the body's sensitivity to insulin and regulates periods. The contraceptive Pill can regulate periods and help with acne and excess hair. Sometimes surgery will be performed to reduce the number of ovarian cysts. Women who wish to have a family will be offered fertility treatment. Being overweight increases the symptoms, so exercise and a careful diet can also help.\nMY STORY: Lorraine Branch, 34, a PR manager, is single and lives in Wimbledon, London. She says: I'd been on the Pill since 13 because I suffered from painful and heavy periods that lasted six weeks. Unfortunately, while the Pill helped with this, it also masked the symptoms of PCOS, and it wasn't until I was 20 and wanted to try for a baby with my then partner that the problem emerged. Within a couple of weeks of coming off the Pill, I had acne and hair had sprouted onmy stomach, feet, chin and upper lip.\nAfter a year, I still had not conceived so I saw a gynaecologist, who diagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome. I was upset because I wanted a family, but I was also focused on getting rid of the hair and acne. I have been on different versions of the Pill ever since. One, Dianette, helped my acne and facial hair, but left me depressed and weepy.\nLast year I changed to Yasmin, which minimises my symptoms without the side-effects. I also follow a strict diet - avoiding sweet food - and I exercise regularly to maintain a healthy weight.\nSYMPTOMS: Weight gain, depression, inability to tolerate the cold, constipation, dry skin, thin hair, memory problems, croaky voice, hearing problems, raised blood pressure or, more rarely, unexplained swelling in the neck, and fertility problems.\nCAUSE: Normally, the thyroid gland in the neck produces two hormones, thyroxin and triodothyronine, which regulate the speed at which cells and organs function. With hypothyroidism, the gland cannot produce enough to meet demand.\nThe main cause is the body's own immune cells attacking the thyroid gland. Surgery and certain medication, such as lithium taken for depression, can also be a cause; stress may play a part, too. Temporary hypothyroidism can occur after childbirth.\nUntreated, hypothyroidism can raise the risk of heart disease, as the lack of thyroxin increases the amount of cholesterol circulating in the blood. The disease largely affects women - one in 50, compared with just one in 1,000 men.\nTREATMENT: A daily tablet of levothyroxin, a synthetic form of thyroxin, to make up for the shortfall. The condition can't be cured, so thyroxin has to be taken indefinitely, and the dosage may have to be increased.\nMY STORY: Elaine Smith, 44, is an MP in the Scottish Parliament. She is married to Vann and they have a son of 11, also called Vann. She says: The first sign of a problem was when I went from a size 12 to a size 18 in less than a year. I was not eating any more than usual, but even dieting made no difference - I finally suspected something was wrong after going shopping one day. I was so exhausted that I had to spend the afternoon in bed.\nMy mother had hypothyroidism and had gone from being an incredibly active woman to having little energy, and I started to wonder if I had it, too. A blood test showed I was producing barely any thyroxin - I was quite upset by the news because I knew it was a life-long condition which could be very serious if not kept in check.\nI also learned that a lot of my minor complaints - such as thinning hair - were a common sign of the disease. And I discovered that my condition was the reason why, despite trying for years, my husband and I had not managed to conceive.\nThe thyroxin took a few weeks to work but soon I felt reborn. My hair grew back and my depression lifted like a weight off my shoulders. I went on a diet and started to shift the weight. Best of all, within a year I was pregnant.\nI was worried that taking thyroxin might be a danger to my baby or would prevent me breastfeeding, but I was assured that was not the case.\nSYMPTOMS: Exhaustion, headaches and a raging thirst; possibly also weight loss or weight gain and changes to appetite.\nCAUSE: The pituitary gland is situated near the brain and produces many different hormones needed to stimulate the production of other hormones in the body. For example, it produces lutenising hormone, which stimulates the ovaries to produce other hormones. Sufferers of hypopituitarism don't produce enough of these 'trigger' hormones, often because of a (usually) benign tumour on the gland itself, although other causes include head trauma, brain surgery and stroke. About 70,000 to 80,000 men and women in the UK suffer from it.\nTREATMENT: Initially the patient may need surgery to remove the tumour; thereafter they need daily hormone treatment to replace the 'trigger' hormones that are no longer produced. Even those who don't require surgery will still need to take replacement hormones.\nMY STORY: Youlie Giovanovits, 34, is a web designer from Dawlish, Devon. She says: Until my diagnosis I would get up as many as ten times a night to go to the loo and I was always thirsty: I could drink a litre-and-a-half of water in one go. To me, it just became normal but then, when I was 19, my periods stopped and my mum insisted I see the GP.\nA blood test revealed some of the levels of my hormones were out, and I was referred to an endocrinologist. An MRI scan showed I had a tumour around my pituitary gland, which was slowly destroying it.\nA few weeks later I had the tumour and some of my pituitary gland removed. As a result, I will have to take hormones every day for the rest of my life. I take a nasal spray of hormones to act on the kidneys so that I do not produce too much urine, hydrocortisol to replace adrenaline, HRT to replace oestrogen, as well as desmopressin to control my thirst and urge to go to the loo. The most significant effect of my condition is that I am infertile. However, I have never wanted kids, but I do wonder if my lack of hormones is responsible for that, too.\nSYMPTOMS: Extreme tiredness, weakness, depression, constipation, increased thirst and nausea.\nCAUSE: The pea-sized hyperparathyroid glands sit on top of the thyroid glands in the neck. The parathyroid glands, of which there are usually four, secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates the amount of calcium in the blood.\nIn hyperparathyroidism, one or more of these glands becomes enlarged. Often the cause in unknown, although it is sometimes caused by kidney failure. As a result, too much PTH is produced; too much calcium is then absorbed from food and calcium is even leached from the bones. The excess calcium may lead to kidney stones and potentially fatal kidney damage. It can also lead to osteoporosis. The condition affects around 100,000 people in the UK, with around 15,000 new cases - mostly women over the age of 50 - diagnosed each year.\nTREATMENT: Surgery to remove the enlarged gland is the most common treatment, and in the majority of cases this clears the condition for good. However, some patients can go on to become hypoparathyroid, where too little PTH is produced and so there is not enough calcium in the blood. This can be treated with vitamin D and calcium tablets.\nMY STORY: Jill Dewsbury, 59, from Walcott, Norfolk, is married with two daughters. She says: For many years I felt extreme fatigue. I lost one of my daughters in 2001, and over the next five years my weight ballooned to 17st, so I put the tiredness down to the grief and being overweight.\nBut last summer, after losing 7st and still feeling no better, I began to think it was just me being lazy. Then I started to get really thirsty and needing to go to the loo far more than normal. My doctor ran tests for diabetes, which were negative, but showed extremely high calcium levels. I saw a specialist in Januaryand he found that one of my parathyroid glands was enlarged. He said removing it could help me feel better again, and reduce my risk of osteoporosis. I had surgery in June and hope I will soon be leaping about and feeling I can get on with life.\nSYMPTOMS: Restlessness, persistent irritability, feeling highly strung or being \"always on the go\", difficulty sleeping, weight loss despite a good or increased appetite, palpitations, sweating, a dislike of heat, and diarrhoea; a goitre - a swelling in the neck as the thyroid gland becomes enlarged.\nCAUSE: Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much of the hormone thyroxin. This makes the cells and organs work too fast so, for example, the heart may start to race. The most common cause is Graves disease, where the body's own immune cells attack the gland, so it produces excess thyroxin. The reason this happens is unknown but there can be an inherited tendency.\nMajor stresses such as losing a loved one, moving home or having a baby can also cause occasional bouts of hyperthyroidism. The condition affects two in 100 women and two in 1,000 men.\nTREATMENT: The drug carbimazole helps to reduce the amount of thyroxin produced-Surgery may also be used to reduce the size of the gland. Patients will then be given thyroxin to ensure regular levels.\nAnother option is radioactive iodine tablets. Iodine accumulates in the gland, killing off the part producing too much thyroxin without any ill effects.\nFor years I'd suffered from heart palpitations, sleeplessness and trembling hands, but my doctor blamed it on anxiety. Then, during a routine check when I was five months' pregnant, another doctor noticed a swelling in my neck. He",
        "baseline": " said he thought I had a thyroid problem. A blood test showed I had an extremely over-active thyroid gland, and when he checked my heart rate, it was going at 200 beats a minute - it should have been about 100. The baby's heart was also racing and I was warned she might not make it.\nI was rushed off for treatment, and I have never been so scared. I was given betablockers to get my heart rate down and Valium to counter the effects of the thyroxin. Within two days I felt better than I had in my whole life: I felt relaxed, and my palms weren't sweaty.\n2003. A few months later, though, I felt ill again. Doctors advised me that my thyroid gland was so erratic that it would be best to remove it. As a result, I have the opposite condition - hypothyroidism - and have to take thyroxin. But I feel a million times better than I used to."

It’s sizzurp, a popular drink made with cough syrup (usually the prescription-strength kind with codeine), 7-Up and Jolly Ranchers candies.\nRapper T.I. (real name Clifford Harris Jr.) and his wife Tameka “Tiny” Cottle were arrested late Wednesday night in L.A. for drug possession when police searched the couple’s car, after smelling marijuana wafting from it at a traffic stop, and found pills that were believed to be ecstasy. Photos taken of the car at the time of arrest also showed Styrofoam cups, an iconic symbol of sizzurp, sparking Internet rumors that the couple were abusing the drug-laced drink.\nThere has not been any confirmation that cough syrup was a factor in T.I. and Tiny’s arrest, but the drink has long been popular within the hip-hop community. It is often mentioned in songs, like Three 6 Mafia’s “Sippin’ on Some Sizzurp” and Lil’ Wayne’s “Me and My Drank.” Since it’s typically drunk from Styrofoam cups, music videos often use the cups as props to suggest the presence of the substance, while staying on the right side of the FCC. (LAWeekly has put together a top 10 list of sizzurp-inspired videos.) Unsurprisingly, sizzurp is also popular with teenagers — it’s cheap and easy to make, even if you’re underage.

        "prompt": "Stew, As a former 82nd Airborne Division officer/​paratrooper and current firefighter/​paramedic, I love your workouts — thanks for all you do! I have an app (cardio trainer) that I use to keep track of my mileage when I run or ruck. It also keeps track of calories burned but obviously it is not the primary reason for my workouts. It is a fun motivator though. My question is, do you know of any sort of calorie conversion for ruck marching? The app tells me how many I burned for walking 5 miles (and I realize that is just an estimate, but I assume I burn a lot more calories carrying a 40 pound ruck the same distance. It would just be fun to know how many?\nGreat question and thanks! I do not know the weighted walk conversions BUT I would guess it would be similar to if you weighed an extra 40 lbs you would burn more calories. As you know a 250 lbs person burns more calories walking than a 200 lbs person.\nI just went to a calorie calculator online and did a 60 min walk at 4 miles per hour for my weight of 200lbs — I burn 468 calories. With 50lb pack I would weigh 250lbs and I would burn 585 calories for the same pace.\nSo it looks like you can add in 100–150 calories by adding a 40–50 lb back pack to a 4 mph walk.\nSince walking with a ruck at 4mph is the bare minimum standards for military rucking — here is a good test if you put out a little more. Try 5mph or a 12 min mile with 40lbs. Still not blazing fast but a better indicator of effort with /​ without a ruck. If you input a 60 min jog at 5 miles per hour for a weight of 200lbs — I burn 768 calories. With 50lb pack I would weigh 250lbs and I would burn 960 calories for the same pace.\nSo it looks like you can add in 100–200 calories by adding a 40–50 lb back pack to a fast walk/​jog depending on your weight and pace.\nNow there is a",
        "baseline": " calorie burning standard for backpacking, which is typically a weighted stroll at a much slower pace of 1–2 mph. At my weight of 200 lbs, I burned 670 calories “backpacking” and 840 calories burned if I place an extra 50lbs on me. So — yes it makes sense that you would burn more calories by either going faster than “backpacking pace” which I would average out at 4–5 mph as well as when you are carrying even more weight in a ruck.\nSo a precise answer is tough as this is a bit all over the place. I think a safe calorie estimate for rucking with 40-​​50lbs is to add 40 — 50% to what a walking /​ jogging calorie burn would be at that pace. So if you are burning 450 calories just walking at 4mph, then you would add 180–225 calories to that number of 450 and get roughly 630 — 675 calories burned an hour with rucking."

Housing Access Control, the UCLA housing department in charge of security surveillance on the Hill, has had a large number of openings since the beginning of the school year. However, annual trends show that low levels of employment are typical in the fall.\nJunji Toshima, the assistant director in Housing & Hospitality Services’ Safety & Emergency Preparedness told The Bruin the safety of students is not compromised, in spite of the short staffing.

        "prompt": "When Should A Scientist’s Faith Disqualify Him From Scientific Institutional Authority?\nI anticipated creationists figuring in your reply. The problem is, though, I’m not really sure they’re the best example of religion ‘polluting’ the scientific endeavor. Outside of other creationists and evangelical Christians, nobody takes ‘creation scientists’ seriously. If these people were peddling their faith-polluted science in peer-reviewed journals and whatnot I think you’d have a point, but since these people aren’t really part of any respected scientific circles I wonder if it’s appropriate to call them scientists in any meaningful sense. On the other hand, all 10 of the folks Dr. Heddle referred to in his challenge are respected members of the scientific establishment who publish in peer-reviewed journals and generally seem to be good scientists. If you could tell me how you detected the 5 religious scientists among them–or how to detect the pollution of religion in any scientific endeavor that has managed to pass peer review–I would be a bit more impressed.\nI brought up the creationists as an example simply of how faith based reasoning is unscientific. I never in any of this said that the creationists were considered legitimate scientists or that religious scientists as any kind of rule brought their faith into the laboratories. I cited the potential areas of conflict with Dr. Collins where he has explicitly said false things (like that altruism is not observed elsewhere in the animal kingdom) or showed a willingness to let dogmatic religious beliefs close off avenues of explanation.\nBut I was not arguing that any good scientists were bad scientists just because on Sunday mornings they jettisoned their laboratory’s intellectual scruples at church. My focus of my point was that insofar as their science is good it does not employ faith. So faith and science are NOT compatible in the lab. And in a fully rationally scrupulous life, they’re not coherently compatible in a full picture of the world where Monday-Friday, the world is investigable view critical reasoning. And on Sundays, centuries old arbitrary faith claims not subject to critical rejection are taken to have mystically guaranteed authority. That’s the whole point. That the existence of scientists who live in cognitive dissonance does not prove faith and science are consistently capable of rational reconciliation.\nThank you for your links to both Harris’ clarifications on his original piece and Myers’ post, but I must admit I find neither to be particularly convincing. Although I won’t go into too much detail (I’m not sure what the size restrictions on comments on this blog are), suffice it to say that to be most accomodating to your viewpoint, and to concede that Harris has proven Collins’ religious views are stupid and unscientific, I still wasn’t very convinced that they would actually harm his science. Despite his ‘problematic’ views on stem cell research, Harris admits he would probably not be able to do much damage to it as director of NIH. Harris casts aspersions on how Collins has said that “science offers no answers to the most pressing questions of human existence and that the claims of atheistic materialism must be steadfastly resisted,” but these are rather vague statements, and it seems to me Harris is reaching quite a bit by assuming that Collins would be opposed to understanding ‘human wellbeing at the neurological level’ or that he views methodological naturalism to be exactly the same thing as atheistic materialism. Perhaps he does, but Harris’ article has not convinced me.\nIn regards to Dr. Myers’ post, while Collins may not possess ‘integrity’ in regards to his religious beliefs and in the sense of ‘unimpaired and sound in construction,’ neither do plenty of other scientists in regards to other secular matters–to take the example of Dawkins again, despite his advocacy of rationality he opposes foxhunting for fundamentally irrational reasons (his parents told him to) and his arguments have tended to be vitriolically irrational (even if, as you say below, it’s okay to be mean so long as you make cogent arguments, making fun of the way someone pronounces ‘nuclear’ is just meanness for the sake of meanness and not a cogent argument for or against anything). Dr. Myers is on stronger ground when he mentions how he fears Collins may use his post to inappropriately evangelize, but again, I’m still not convinced by this either. He may have gotten Clinton to mention some religious stuff and talked about ‘The Language of God’ and all that, but given the disproportionate representation of other religions in the medical establishment, such as Muslims and Hindus, I find it hard to believe that Collins has a proven track record of being inappropriately evangelistic, because if he had, he almost certainly would have offended someone important a while ago and wouldn’t have managed to get as high as he did in his position in the Human Genome Project.\nand 2: That there is some meaningful, tangible way in which religion undermines religion.\nSo, while calling people pinheads, he speaks outside of his specialization to wander into epistemology, demanding an empirical argument for what is a normative claim—making it pretty clear he cannot discern the difference between the two.\nWell, he may have his own response to that, but just to make sure we’re on the same page, what *is* the difference between the two? You’ll have to excuse my ignorance here, whereas you have a doctorate in philosophy (I think) I’m just a Wandering Internet Commentator whose experience with philosophy extends no farther than a 101 college class. So if you wouldn’t mind me asking, just what is the difference between an empirical argument and a normative argument, and why should we consider the latter having as much merit as the former, or even any merit at all?\nDr. Heddle equated the New Atheists aggressively advancing atheism publicly as tantamount to overstepping the bounds of their scientific specialties in a comparable way to James Dobson wanting to influence public policy rather than focus on spreading the “gospel.” That’s pretty much a “stay out of public discussion and stick to your jobs of promoting evolution” line to me. For a brief start towards answering your other question (about why normative arguments should have merit), click here and respond to this post addressing it.\nWhy wouldn’t I? Didn’t I just argue that their intellectual scruples should not be left in the lab? I am a philosopher and I specialize in ethics, I am concerned with scrupulousness in all manners of belief and action, be they matters of inquiry in philosophy, history, social sciences, natural sciences, religion, politics, etc. I am against irrationalism.\nWhether or not rationality is the supreme, greatest, or even best good and whether or not irrationality is something to be weeded out and eschewed in general is a debate I shall again refrain from having here, but I brought up the example of Dawkins simply to illustrate that if you believe Collins is a bad scientist and should be denied his position on the basis of holding bad beliefs for bad reasons, one could make the same argument for very many other famous scientists, Richard Dawkins not being the least among them.\nI will simply reiterate that if you believe Collins is ineligible for his NIH position because his theological and epistemological views are incorrect and able to be refuted, one could make similar arguments that Dawkins and other atheistic scientists are ineligible for their position because they have incorrect and refutable views on secular matters ranging from ethics to means of argumentation or whatever.\nI didn’t say Collins was all-bad as a scientist. I said that there were worrisome infections of his attitudes towards scientific projects that came from religious prejudices. Whether or not those play out or have played out in tangible practical scientific matters is ultimately up for those with more knowledge of his track record than I to assess. What I can say though is that the concerns about him have to do not with his religious beliefs but with his explicit attempts to relate them to science and show how they demarcate for him the limits of science.\nAs Myers has pointed out (in a post I can’t seem to locate right now) we live in a nation chock full of Christians and have had numerous Christians as NIH heads with no peeps of complaint from New Atheists. The issue is not their private beliefs, which we may criticize the way we criticize any one’s private beliefs but not consider to have bearing on their job performance insofar as they do not interfere with their job performance. I may have loopy ideas about economics but that doesn’t make me a bad philosophy teacher as long as in my capacity as philosophy teacher I do not presume to speak unqualifiedly on economics.\nWe are all probably shallow and painfully bad thinkers on the majority of topics outside our specializations and active hobby interests. So, it has not mattered whether previous NIH heads held religious beliefs or not. What matters in this case is Collins has specifically merged his science and his faith and made explicit arguments about their compatibility and the supposed effects of limiting scientifically acceptable answers in accord with his interpretation of his faith. He has made his religious beliefs part of his scientific identity, choosing to leverage his scientific credibility to bolster the credibility of believing on faith (“if this great scientist thinks faith is rational, then how can we less intelligent people call it irrational?”) There are consequences to doing that when faith is antithetical in principle to rigorous naturalistic scientific investigation.\nNow, maybe in the past Collins has kept the two segregated in practice wherever real knowledge was on the line. In that case all his showy language about faith and science mixing just fine is revealed to be something he does not believe in practice since he knows in practice faith is bad thinking that would corrupt his science (which is where he does his serious thinking). So, maybe that’s all he’s doing. Claiming that faith and science are compatible just because he adopts both whereas in practice he carefully separates them and implicitly reveals his real awareness that they’re not compatible and mutually reinforcing at all. So, maybe he safely keeps faith out of his science and will do so as NIH director. But since he made an issue of stressing their compatibility, this should be scrutinized carefully and I find some of the red flags suspicious. Beyond those flags, I cannot speak since I am not an expert on his career by any means.\nIf Dawkins used his scientific posts to argue for methods of reasoning (such as faith-based ones) that contradicted scientific methods when relating to scientific issues, then he would indeed be worthy of the same criticisms. If his politics are bad or his ethical judgments badly formed (and, again, I’m not sure I trust his own judgment on that) the question is “does he make part of his platform his willingness to mix these with his science as Collins does when he wants to use his scientific cred to bolster faith?” If so, then “hell yes” we would have a serious problem with Dawkins. Soviet science was infamously corrupted by political dogmatism, so we can say there are real possibilities in theory for anti-religious dogmatisms also to infect science and there are instances of it happening. If somehow Dawkins tailored his scientific theories simply to critique Bush or deer hunters then he would be a bad scientist who should not have any authority over major scientific institutions.\nBut, in",
        "baseline": " fact, Dawkins shows a fascinating willingness to both argue vehemently that we embrace the fact of selfish genes as the most essential evolutionary unit while vehemently denouncing Social Darwinism politically. If he were letting his English socialism politics corrupt his science, surely he wouldn’t be one of the coldest proponents of selfishness (metaphorically) being the key to successful evolution! But he adequately recognizes that our social and moral norms are a separate matter from how evolution objectively works. He thinks it functions along principles at odds with socialistic ideals.\nI am a passionate Darwinian when it comes to the science of how life has actually evolved, but a passionate ANTI-Darwinian when it comes to the politics of how humans ought to behave. I have several times said that a society based on Darwinian principles would be a very unpleasant society in which to live.\nFor more on what I think constitutes unjustifiably leveraging one’s credibility (as Collins does to an extent), click here."

        "prompt": "After much anticipation, Snapchat's parent company finally debuts on the stock market. It gets off to a fast start.\nSnapchat is officially a public company.\nSnapchat, the disappearing-photo app that's an all-consuming obsession for young people, is coming of age.\nIn one of the most anticipated tech IPOs in years, its parent company, Snap, went public Thursday morning, with a preopen share price set at $17.\nThat price didn't last long. Snap shares started trading just before 11:30 a.m. ET with an opening price of $24, a jump of 41 percent and a strong signal that investors are buying into the young company's promise. During the course of the day, the stock price came within a few cents of $26 before settling to close at $24.48, a first-day gain of 44 percent.\nThe co-founders, CEO Evan Spiegel and CTO Bobby Murphy, rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, where the shares are trading under the ticker symbol SNAP.\nSnap is hoping to raise more than $3 billion with its IPO, money it's going to use to do things like hire more employees or make acquisitions.\nIf you haven't been keeping up, Snap has been one of tech's unlikeliest success stories in years. Started by Spiegel, a 26-year-old Stanford University dropout, the app was once dismissed as a sexting app before finding massive adoption among teens and young adults.\nNow the Los Angeles-based social network is emerging as one of the biggest threats to Facebook and Twitter. Its claim to fame: popularizing casual social networking. Since posts quickly disappear, people don't have to worry about their photos and videos being around or impressive enough to stand the test of time. What Snap has shown is that people can feel comfortable posting anything, from the mundane to amusing.\nAnd young people love it. Nearly 70 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds in the US use the app, according to ComScore. More than 150 million people use the service every day.\nThat's why Snap has drawn the ire and envy of Silicon Valley's biggest companies. Most notably, Facebook is trying to duplicate its product mojo, with a near-identical clone of Snapchat Stories, which lets people post strings of videos and photos that self-detonate after 24 hours.\nStill, the company has its challenges. In its IPO filing released last month, Snap warned of slowing user growth. That explains why Spiegel is hoping to convince investors it's not merely a social media company, but instead a \"camera company.\"\nSnap has already released Spectacles, $130 sunglasses equipped with a camera to make it easy for people to post photos and videos to Snapchat. The company also reportedly has worked on a drone for photographing people from overhead.\n\"In the way that the flashing cursor became the starting point for most products on desktop computers, we believe that the camera screen will be the starting point for most products on smartphones,\" the company wrote in its IPO filing. \"This means that we are willing to take risks in an attempt to create innovative and different camera products that are better able to reflect and improve our life experiences.\"\nBut even though Snap had a good first day on the market, that doesn't mean it's in the clear. Twitter, which went public in 2013, had a very successful debut on the stock market, with its shares popping 73 percent. Four years later, the company is struggling to get mainstream users beyond celebrities and media types and to make money off its products.\nFacebook, on the other hand, had what many characterized as a disappointing first day on the market in 2012. Now, of course, it has almost 2 billion users and is a perennial Wall Street darling.\nIn a note to investors late Thursday, Aegis Capital listed a number of concerns about Snap's business, including the lack of an ecosystem, lack of a clear path toward profitability, the mix and targeting of ads, and \"the ease by which ... Facebook has been replicating parts of Snapchat's product.\" It set a year-end target of $22 for Snap's shares.\nStill, there's a positive in Snapchat's",
        "baseline": " allure for young people. \"We conducted extensive checks within the ad industry,\" Aegis' Victor Anthony wrote, \"and find that marketers are enthusiastic about the prospects of creating ads to get in front of Snap's coveted demographic.\"\nThe thing to remember is that an IPO is just one day. Now that Snap is a public company, a new marathon begins.\n\"We built our business on creativity,\" Spiegel told the LA Times on Thursday after the shares started trading. \"And we're going to have to go through an education process for the next five years to explain to people how our users and that creativity creates value.\"\nFirst published March 2 at 6:55 a.m. PT.\nUpdated several times, most recently March 3 at 6:02 a.m. PT: On Thursday, added the opening share price for Snap shares and, later, the closing price for the day and analysis as well as more background information. On Friday, added comment from Aegis Capital."

        "prompt": "Seated left to right are Viktor Averin, Sergei Mikhailov and Andrei Skoch. Lev Kvetnoy, a former partner of Alisher Usmanov, is in the back row on the far left.\nThe photograph is low quality and appears similar to any taken of a group of male friends after dinner in post-Communist Moscow. But contained within this grainy 1994 shot, are some remarkable characters who have suddenly started to fascinate City bankers.\nOn the bottom right is Andrei Skoch, now rated as the richest man sitting in the Duma, Russia's parliament. He is also a close friend of the billionaire oligarch and Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov and indirectly a leading figure behind MegaFon, the Russian telecoms business that Usmanov jointly listed on the London and Moscow stock markets on Wednesday.\nSitting next to Skoch is Sergei Mikhailov and, next to him on the front row is Viktor Averin. These are said to be two of Russia's most feared gangsters.\nThese old connections have suddenly resurfaced as MegaFon – which last week announced the appointment to its board of former Labour minister and one time chairman of the Guardian Media Group Lord Myners – began trading 17% of its shares in London. Coincidentally, that is almost the same size of stake indirectly owned by the Skoch family. The shares fell nearly 3% on their first day.\nSkoch, who has placed all of his business interests in the name of his father, Vladimir, declined to answer any questions about his connections when approached by the Guardian in Moscow last week. In a response to questions by email, a spokesperson for Usmanov said there have been \"too many unwarranted allegations, rumours and speculations about different people in Russia\".\nHowever, Skoch was prepared to give an interview to last Friday's Financial Times in which he admitted knowing Mikhailov and Averin. He also previously spoke about the ties in a 2010 interview with the Russian business newspaper Vedomosti, during which he confirmed that the photo was genuine.\nHe said that he got to know Mikhailov after he and Lev Kvetnoy bought several service companies at Moscow's Vnukovo airport.\nSkoch added that he was \"introduced\" to Mikhailov and Averin as the \"owners\" of the Vnukovo companies. \"We met, discussed terms, and then agreed – the photo was taken afterwards,\" he said.\nAverin subsequently invited him and his wife to a holiday in Prague, in 1995. Skoch was one of 50 guests who celebrated Averin's birthday at the Ritz Hotel. In his Vedomosti interview, Skoch said the guests had been sitting down for 15 minutes over dinner when the Czech police burst in. The police took all the guests down to the station for questioning, photographed them and then let them go. \"After that I didn't have any shared history with Viktor [Averin]. Not with him, not with Sergei [Mikhailov]. We didn't have any joint interests,\" he said.\nHowever, Skoch told the FT last week that he continued to meet Averin for business purposes after the incident, with their last meeting seven years ago when they bumped into each other at a Moscow restaurant. \"He's a nice enough guy,\" he told the paper.\nThe politician, whose wealth has been valued by Forbes at $4.2bn (£2.6bn), denied that he, Mikhailov or Averin had any links with Russian organised crime. \"I can't say they were bandits. They were ordinary businessmen,\" he told the FT.\n\"I couldn't say that anyone joined a [mafia] group. That would be incorrect,\" Skoch also told Vedomosti. In the lawless Russia of the 1990s, he said it wasn't entirely clear \"who was in a mafia group and who wasn't\". \"You'd go into any restaurant and there would be a serious-looking guy sitting there. If you wanted to live, you had to be unafraid,\" he said.\nHowever, according to Federico Varese, professor of criminology at Oxford University, Mikhailov is the alleged founder of the \"Solntsevo fraternity\", Russia's most powerful mafia gang.\nThe group is named after a rundown area of western and southwestern Moscow – the name Solntsevo would translate as Sunnyside in English. Varese dubs the gang",
        "baseline": " \"arguably the mightiest organised crime group to emerge from the wreckage of the Soviet Union.\"\nIn the same Vedomosti interview Skoch boasts of his close friendship with Usmanov – who has also faced questions about links to Gafur Rakhimov.\nUsmanov denies that he has ever had any business dealings with Rakhimov, whom he says was a neighbour of his parents.\nSkoch recalled that he met Usmanov in 1995, and went into business, buying a metallurgical industrial complex. The venture succeeded thanks to Usmanov's \"intellect\", Skoch said, adding: \"We are very close. I trust him with my life.\"\nIn 2010 Skoch said he saw Usmanov \"virtually every day\" and had travelled with him to Tashkent when Usmanov had a major operation.\n• This article was amended on 29 January 2013 to remove an incorrect reference to Gafur Rakhimov."

        "prompt": "Q: Can raspberry cordial kill stomach bugs in contaminated water?\nA: Yes. Raspberry and blackcurrant cordials can kill bacteria that cause some stomach bugs.\nHave you ever used cordial to prevent gastro bugs? Have your say on the messageboard below.\nFor most of us, cordial is off the shopping list; we avoid it because it's full of sugar, bad for our teeth and some of its artificial colourings can make some kids hyperactive.\nBut raspberry cordial has some very loyal fans, who don't necessarily enjoy its sweet taste.\nThese people keep it in the pantry because they swear it can prevent  and possibly treat  stomach bugs. And they may be right, says microbiologist Dr Heather Cavanagh, whose research found some raspberry juice and blackcurrant juice cordials can kill at least 12 different types of nasty bacteria responsible for stomach bugs, including E. Coli and several strains of salmonella.\nCavanagh first became interested in the use of raspberry cordial as a preventative and treatment of stomach bugs when she heard that some farmers in parts of New South Wales and Victoria were adding raspberry cordial to their livestock's drinking water to treat diarrhoea.\nShe also began to hear stories of other people using raspberry cordial to treat stomach bugs: \"I heard anecdotal reports from as far away as Queensland and Western Australia, I heard of how people used it to treat themselves and their family. Not just their animals\".\nSo she decided to see if there was any science to support these anecdotal reports.\nIn the lab, Cavanagh tested juice made from a number of fresh berries  including raspberries, blackberries, blackcurrants, cranberries, mulberries, loganberries and boysenberries  as well as commercially available cordials made from these berries (these cordials were made with real berry juice, not apple juice and artificial colours as is sometimes the case).\nThese juices and cordials were then diluted down with water to different strengths, the strongest was one part water to five parts cordial and the weakest was 1:100. Then each type of bacteria was mixed with each of the berry drinks. The researchers found a number of the raspberry and blackcurrant juice cordials killed most of the bacteria.\nAnd while there has been some speculation that it's the sugar content of cordials that kills bacteria, Cavanagh says there is something unique to raspberry and blackcurrant juices, which seems to be responsible.\nThose cordials that had the best antibacterial properties contained at least 35 per cent raspberry or blackcurrant juice, and worked when diluted down to one part cordial in 10 parts water. Undiluted raspberry juice and blackcurrant juice worked just as well as the cordials.\nBut, Cavanagh says, there's a hitch. While her research suggests there's some truth to the red cordial story, there haven't been any clinical trials testing whether raspberry cordial can prevent or treat stomach bugs in humans or animals.\n\"We know for certain that adding the right amount of these cordials to water will reduce the number of bacteria in the water,\" she says.\n\"[But] we cannot say for certain that the cordial will definitely prevent stomach bugs in people",
        "baseline": ", and we don't know yet if it will help as a treatment if you are already feeling sick. Although again there is some anecdotal evidence to suggest that it might.\"\nAnd even if red cordial does work, stomach bugs (gastroenteritis) are caused by a range of things other than bacteria  such as viruses, parasites, and certain medications  and raspberry cordial won't help in these cases.\nAlso be careful about drinking too much cordial (even diluted at a 1:10 ratio) if you have vomiting or diarrhoea. Drinks with a high sugar content  such as undiluted soft drinks, sports drinks, juices or strong cordials  can promote fluid loss into the bowel and worsen dehydration, which is a risk for anyone with vomiting and diarrhoea.\nDr Heather Cavanagh is a senior lecturer in microbiology at the School of Biomedical Sciences at Charles Sturt University. She spoke to Claudine Ryan."
