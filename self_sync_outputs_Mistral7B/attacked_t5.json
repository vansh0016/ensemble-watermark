Although the Terriers gave up the ball a good amount themselves, their zone never allowed Holy Cross to get comfortable when the Crusaders (12-10, 3-6 Patriot League) were on offense.\nHoly Cross turned the ball over seven times in the first half, leading to several easy baskets for BU in transition.

Her company, founded in 1997, currently performs various characters in history and develops literacy programs at schools, colleges, military bases, churches or where ever needed.\nBefore the audience at the Wagon Wheel Theater, Waddy-Thibodeaux transformed herself from a 20th century CEO into the legendary Harriet Tubman and relayed the story of the Underground Railroad, while delivering a message on the importance of literacy. She told the audience the Underground Railroad was \"Just people, people helping other people. And don't let nobody tell you no never mind that the Underground Railroad was all colored folks. No, there were Dutch, Portuguese, French, Chinese, Indian, white folks, colored, all of them working together,\" Waddy-Thibodeaux told the audience through her Harriet Tubman character.\nA powerful recital of Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech was also presented by 2nd Lt. Zayana Dennis and there was a musical performance by Pfc. Tamika Torain.\nThe Baumholder American Middle and High School allowed several students to attend the performance, which was held during school hours. After the performance, Lt. Col.

        "prompt": "ASHEBORO, N.C. (Reuters) - When Bill McAnulty, an elections board chairman in a mostly white North Carolina county, agreed in July to open a Sunday voting site where black church members could cast ballots after services, the reaction was swift: he was labeled a traitor by his fellow Republicans.\n“I became a villain, quite frankly,” recalled McAnulty at a state board of elections meeting in September that had been called to resolve disputes over early voting plans. “I got accused of being a traitor and everything else by the Republican Party,” McAnulty said.\nFollowing the blowback from Republicans, McAnulty later withdrew his support for the Sunday site.\nIn an interview with Reuters, he said he ultimately ruled against opening the Sunday voting site in Randolph County because he had “made a mistake in reading the wishes of the voters.” He declined to discuss the episode further.\nThis year’s highly charged presidential contest between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump has stoked accusations by both parties of political meddling in the scheduling of early voting hours in North Carolina, a coveted battleground state with a history of tight elections.\nIn emails, state and county Republican officials lobbied members of at least 17 county election boards to keep early-voting sites open for shorter hours on weekends and in evenings – times that usually see disproportionately high turnout by Democratic voters. Reuters obtained the emails through a public records request.\nThe officials also urged county election boards to open fewer sites for residents to cast ballots during early voting that began on Oct. 20 and ends on Saturday.\nCivil rights advocates and Democrats launched their own campaigns for expanded early voting hours.\nThe tug-of-war yielded mixed results.\nThe state did ultimately add nearly 5,900 more hours and 78 more sites to vote early than in 2012. But several counties opened only one polling site during the first week of early voting, slightly denting turnout across the state. Voter turnout dropped by 20 percent in the counties that had multiple polling sites during the first week of early voting in 2012 but just one site during the first week in 2016.\n“We currently have more early voting locations and hours open than ever were open under Democrat control,” said North Carolina Republican Party executive director Dallas Woodhouse, denying his party was trying to suppress the Democratic vote.\nPresident Barack Obama praised the expanded early voting opportunities during an election stop in North Carolina on Wednesday.\nCounties that Obama, a Democrat, won in 2012 increased their Sunday hours this year by 16 percent, while counties that voted for his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, decreased them by nearly a quarter, the records show.\nState Republican officials say keeping polls open during evenings and weekends, or “off-hour” times, drains county resources.\nIn two emails, on Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, Woodhouse urged Republicans serving on county election boards to follow the “party line” on curtailing the early voting period.\n“Many of our folks are angry and opposed to Sunday voting,” he wrote. “Six days of voting in one week is enough. Period.” Keeping polling sites open for the full 17-day early voting period “may be wasteful and unnecessary,” he added.\nWoodhouse’s emails were subsequently published by local media, but he was not alone in lobbying to limit voting hours, the Reuters review of public records shows. The review counted similar emails from at least four other Republican Party officials to election boards, each of which is composed of two Republicans and one Democrat.\nThe same day that Woodhouse sent his Aug. 11 email, Elaine Hewitt, a member of the Rowan County Republican Executive Committee, sent the county elections board two proposed schedules for early voting, both of which included just one site for the first four days and no sites on Sundays.\n“With all of the opportunities to vote by mail, early in person Monday - Saturday, and on Election Day, there is no justification for requiring election workers to work on Sundays,” she wrote.\nGarry Terry, the chairman of the Republican Party for North Carolina’s First Congressional District, sent an email on Aug. 13 to elections board members in his region, reminding them to act “in the best interest of the Republican Party” by opposing Sunday voting and restricting early voting to one location.\nHewitt and Terry did not respond to requests for comment. Woodhouse defended the actions of the Republican officials, telling Reuters that Republican opposition to Sunday voting was not discriminatory but was rather based on the belief that people should not be required to work on Sundays.\nThe Sunday polling site that McAnulty first supported and then opposed would have been located at the Randolph County Board of Elections office and would have cost around $1,000 to operate, according to the office director.\n“If it’s not wasteful and it allows more people to vote... the board has historically been for that,” Margaret Megerian, the Democratic member of board, told Reuters.\nIn contrast with the Republicans’ email campaign, the Democratic push to expand early voting hours has largely taken shape in public forums.\nIn Democratic-leaning Guilford County, the state’s third largest, a county board of elections meeting on Aug. 8 attracted about 75 people after word spread that the board was planning to halve the number of early voting sites, from 24 in 2012.\nThe Rev. Nelson Johnson said in an interview that the proposal by the board’s Republican chairwoman would “prevent voting especially by people who can’t easily take time off” and said it “absolutely” had a racial intent. Johnson, who is African American, leads a community center in Greensboro, North Carolina.\nBoard Chairwoman Kathryn Lindley told Reuters she believed “a lesser number of sites would cause less confusion about which places were going to be open,” and that it was “ludicrous” to think her suggested plan had been discriminatory.\nThe board ultimately agreed to 25 early voting sites and one day of Sunday voting before the",

The goal has been “wealth” or “human welfare” at least since Adam Smith published “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” in 1776. But what exactly is human welfare? And how do we measure wealth?\nThe obvious way: money. Simply measure how much money a society or individual earns or possesses, because money is so damn simple to count. But various economists have rejected simple as simplistic. Do we not care about values other than money? Education, say? Freedom? Health?\nNobel laureate economist Amartya Sen, for example, has long proposed we instead use a “human development index” that includes variables beyond monetary wealth.\nAnd in using money as your key metric, you miss the side effects of becoming a latter day Uncle Scrooge, swimming in coin.\nConsider the potentially corrosive effects of money on a fellow like Scrooge — there’s experimental evidence that “rich people are more likely to break the law while driving, help themselves to candy meant for children, cheat in a game of chance” or lie, as demonstrated in a Making Sen$e story we did a few years ago. Or more broadly and starkly, imagine that a town becomes “rich” by building a chemical plant, but pollution from the plant poisons its citizens for decades to come.\nThe most dramatic finding is that U.S. counties vary in life expectancy by as much as 20 years.\nThere is, however, one measure that seems relatively unobjectionable: life expectancy at birth. Leaving aside the thorny issue of life extension for its own sake, what is more desirable than more life?\nWhich brings us to the extraordinary new interactive map from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation — a county by county report on life expectancy in the United States as it has developed from 1980 to 2014.\nThe most dramatic finding is that U.S. counties",

Kim Davis, one of the school�s counselors, stays calm and poised while helping resolve the problem.\nIt�s the kind of situation counselors deal with all the time across Alamance County, North Carolina and the rest of the United States. Davis� determination to do that part of her job well while launching efforts to help students thrive in middle school have earned her national recognition. She was a national semifinalist for the 2013 School Counselor of the Year Award by the American School Counselor Association, receiving the award early this month.\nDuring 2011-12, she was named the state�s middle school counselor of the year.\nDavis is 34. She grew up in Graham and is a 1996 graduate of Graham High School. She has a bachelor�s degree from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and a master�s degree in counseling from North Carolina A&T State University. She�s married to Stephen Davis. Her parents are Robert and Brenda Sykes and she has a sister, Leslie Oakley.\nHer path toward becoming a counselor wasn�t as direct as it might have been, but she wanted to work with students.\nShe thought back to her years at Graham High School and remembered the impact counselor Ida Kidd � now at Western Alamance High School � had on her. Combined with the thought she might get to know students and their families, she pursued her counseling degree. Before she was done, former Graham Middle Principal Teresa Faucette had hired her.\nIt wasn�t long before Davis and Faucette were exploring ideas to improve middle school for students. The school began offering a full-day session to incoming sixth-graders to ease the transition from elementary to middle school.\nThe sixth-grade students, Davis pointed out, are going through major changes. They will be the youngest, instead of the oldest, at their schools, and they will be with students coming to Graham Middle from two other elementary schools. Among their concerns, Davis said, are �Am I going to make friends? Am I going to be bullied?\nTo encourage that throughout the school year, she selects 40 eighth-grade students a year to be WEB (Where Everybody Belongs) leaders. They talk with younger",

        "prompt": "German finance minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble looks on as Greece finance minister Yanis Varoufakis speaks.\nGreece’s new SYRIZA government submitted its list of proposed economic reforms to the Eurogroup (the finance ministers of eurozone nations) on February 23 as a precondition for its international creditors to approve a four-month loan extension. The deal was signed on February 20.\nWith Greece’s existing loan arrangement expiring on February 28 and bankruptcy looming, a last-minute deal was finally agreed after three weeks of intense negotiations. The talks had been characterised by daily — sometimes hourly — twists and turns, claims and counterclaims, leaks and threats.\nSYRIZA was elected on January 25 on a wave of hope and rejection of the crippling austerity measures imposed on Greece in return for economic “bail-out” programs by the “Troika” — the European Central Bank (ECB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU). The deal represents a significant compromise on its election platform.\nAny discussion of debt write-offs, “hair-cuts” or renegotiation has been postponed until the next round of negotiations. Funds earmarked for bank recapitalisation will have to be used for that purpose, rather than redirected towards meeting Greece’s desperate social needs.\nGreece no longer has to accept the unilateral diktats of the Troika and is able to negotiate with each body separately. But the new funding still comes with conditions. These include oversight by those same bodies, now referred to as “the institutions”, and restrictions on how the money can be used.\nThe SYRIZA government is required to refrain from any “rollback of measures and unilateral changes to the policies and structural reforms that would negatively impact fiscal targets, economic recovery or financial stability, as assessed by the institutions”.\nAlthough less than specific, this restriction includes any privatisations already completed, as well as those now underway. Depending on interpretation, this may also impact on measures promised by SYRIZA to improve social welfare, such as raising the minimum wage and restoring collective bargaining rights.\nOn the other hand, the agreement also includes measures that will improve SYRIZA’s ability to fund solutions to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Greece.\nTo gather funds, the government is able to crack down on corruption, tax avoidance, tax immunity (Greece’s powerful shipping owners, for instance, currently pay no tax) and smuggling.\nSuch measures target the vested interests of Greece’s powerful oligarchy — something previous governments deliberately avoided — and strengthen the revenue-raising capacity of the Greek state.\nThis approach has already achieved success, with a reported €500 million already raised. It still remains to be seen if enough revenue can be raised to address social needs while repaying Greece’s short-term debts — several billion euros are due for payment in the coming months.\nThe SYRIZA government has described the agreement as a qualified success. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis described it as “a small step in the right direction”.\nVaroufakis said that Greece is now the “co-author” of its own fate, no longer the victim of “autopilot austerity” where it meekly takes economic and policy directives from its creditors.\nIn a marathon 10-hour session on February 25, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras advocated the deal to his fellow SYRIZA MPs as a small but tangible win.\nAcknowledging the restrictive conditions in the interim agreement, Tsipras said that while it is an extension of pre-existing loan arrangements, it is not a continuation of the Memorandum of Understanding that accompanied the previous tranche of loans.\nTsipras said the new deal frees up the government from unrealistic primary surplus targets and “asphyxiating” policies of austerity. While “things remain difficult”, the prime minister said the conditions replace the previous government’s measures with targets based on SYRIZA’s “Thessaloniki program”, which it took into January’s election.\nSYRIZA’s leaders have faced severe internal criticism over the deal, however. It has mostly come from members of the party’s Left Platform, who consider the deal a near-capitulation to Greece’s creditors on the questions of debt and austerity. About 30 of SYRIZA’s 149 MPs, and four government ministers, belong to the Left Platform.\nA Left Platform leader and member of SYRIZA’s central committee, Stathis Kouvelakis, said SYRIZA had carried out a major retreat caused by a “mistaken strategy”. He said the deal showed it was impossible to break with austerity and Greece’s debt burden “within the existing European framework”.\nOn February 25, Greek energy minister and Left Platform supporter Panagiotis Lafazanis said the privatisation of Greece’s main energy company and energy grid operator would not go ahead, a statement that appears at odds with the deal’s conditions.\nThe SYRIZA government has emphasised that its promised social measures will go ahead. In a CNN interview on February 23, Varoufakis insisted “there will be no pension cuts, there will be no increases to Value-Added Tax, there will be a series of poverty-alleviation moves.\nVaroufakis conceded that Greece was forced into significant compromises, admitting on February 20 that he was asking Europe to meet Greece “not half-way, but one-fifth of the way”.\nIn the event, that was a lot more than powerful forces in Europe wanted to give them.\nSYRIZA was elected with a mandate to end austerity, resolve the country’s social crisis and rebuild the Greek economy. The humanitarian crisis caused by austerity has led to a widespread drop in living standards, with about one in four people unemployed (60% of youth) and an average 20% cut in wages for those in work.\nThe negotiation process, therefore, exposed the open contempt for democracy that lies at the heart of the European Union and the financial interests that it represents.\nSchäuble took this uncompromising stance into negotiations, using Germany's dominance within the Eurogroup to demand Greece’s total and unconditional capitulation.\nIf Greece was hoping for support from other countries suffering from austerity, however, it was disappointed. Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Finland — all facing rising political challenges to their pro-austerity governments — sided firmly with Germany, as did France and Italy, leaving Greece isolated.\nMeanwhile, Greece was faced with possible bankruptcy. A run on the banks led to an estimated €3 billion withdrawn in the week before February 20, on top of a further €12 billion withdrawn in January.\nIn the final days before the agreement, the ECB was preparing for a possible “Grexit” — a Greek exit from the eurozone, and therefore the EU.\nVaroufakis had already ruled out a voluntary Grexit on the basis of the economic damage it would cause and the boost it would give to the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn, already the third largest party in the Greek parliament.\nA series of compromise drafts were rejected by Schäuble, who accused the Greeks of trying to present a “Trojan horse”. The claim was echoed in an increasingly nationalistic German media, which blames “lazy Greeks”, rather than a predatory and poorly regulated banking system, for the crisis.\n",

        "prompt": "Who Was in Kiev’s Independence Square?\nNow that Viktor Yanukovych has gone, and new elections are promised, we need to assess the political and popular forces that succeeded in overturning Ukraine’s political system. Who were the protesters and what were their goals? At the barricades in central Kiev there were Ukrainian and EU flags, as well as portraits of the poet Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861), considered as a spiritual father of Ukrainian identity, and of Stepan Bandera (1909-1959) who was, depending on your point of view, either a great patriot or a Nazi collaborator. And there were pictures of five Ukrainian activists, treated as martyrs after they were killed during the clashes in Grushevsky Street.\nMaidan Nezalezhnosti, Kiev’s Independence Square, the epicentre of the protests that had been taking place across Ukraine for three months, was filled with tents pitched by sympathisers from every part of the country: from Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk, the strongholds of nationalism, but also from Lugansk and Donetsk, the big cities of the industrial east, which have always felt close to Russia. Cossacks wore their traditional costume. Women brought black bread and ham to the men standing guard. There was a pervasive smell of tea, cabbage soup and wood fires. During the week, the few thousand activists went about their day-to-day business; on Sundays, tens of thousands came to hear speeches by opposition leaders, pray and sing the national anthem, tirelessly.\nThe protest movement emerged in November last year, after Yanukovych suspended negotiations on a free trade agreement with the European Union (1). Independence Square was gradually transformed. The first to arrive were a few thousand pro-European partisans, but as repression began the square became a symbol of revolt against a corrupt and mercenary political system for many others — initially a revolt against the Yanukovych system, but also a rejection of the opposition parties, out of their depth in this crisis.\nThe involvement of several nationalist groups — a small but highly visible presence — and of ultra-radical, non-democratic movements without European sympathies has produced different reactions. Their presence was used actively by Russia, and to some extent by Yanukovych’s government, to discredit the movement. But it also raised fears of a possible takeover of Independence Square by the far right — even though a popular movement was behind the protests and any attempt to categorise it in political terms would be an over-simplification.\nThe far right is largely modelled on the nationalist movement that developed from the 1920s, when most of what is now Ukraine was divided between Poland and Soviet Russia. From the start it was shaped by a variety of influences: Italian fascism, the partial collaboration — for pragmatic or ideological reasons — of some of its representatives (such as Bandera) with Nazi Germany, the participation of several Ukrainian battalions in the massacre of Jewish and Polish civilians during the second world war.\nPolitical scientist Andreas Umland, who teaches at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, said: “There are no objective historical accounts of Bandera’s [career]. Russian historians portray him as a fascist ally of the Nazis, while Ukrainian historians praise him without reserve. His admirers on Independence Square take a naïve and biased view of him, which is a problem. But it seems equally biased and dishonest to call him a fascist, as the Russians do” (2).\nDormant during the Soviet era, the nationalist movement reappeared after independence in 1991, when the Social-National Party of Ukraine (SNPU) was formed. Until the early 2000s, the SNPU was a marginal, xenophobic and ultra-nationalist organisation, and what little support it had was largely in the west of the country. Its leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, was elected to the Ukrainian parliament for the first time in 1998.\nIn search of respectability, Svoboda established relations with other European far-right parties. Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of France’s Front National, attended the 2004 congress as guest of honour. Svoboda also moderated its nationalist stance and references to Bandera — about whom Ukrainians do not agree — and gradually adopted a more general discourse, relatively common among the European far right, based on radical and vehement criticism of “the system”.\nThis did not prevent Tyahnybok from making statements that recall his xenophobic and anti-Semitic roots. In 2004 he declared that the Ukraine was governed by a “Jewish-Russian mafia”, which led to his exclusion from the Nasha Ukraina (Our Ukraine) parliamentary group. In 2005 he wrote an open letter to the president, demanding that he “put an end to the criminal activities of Ukrainian Jewry”.\nAt the parliamentary elections in 2012, Svoboda won nearly 10.5% of the vote and 37 seats in parliament. With more than two million votes, it became a party of national importance, achieving significant results in parts of the country other than the west, which is traditionally more receptive to nationalism.\nSvoboda, “probably on the advice of [France’s] Front National”, according to Andreas Umland,has also drawn up an economic programme with a social dimension. This would renationalise a number of enterprises, introduce progressive taxation on business profits, and seek to reduce the dominance of the oligarchs over the political and economic systems. These measures, together with the promise of a vigorous campaign against corruption, have attracted some categories of voters, especially small businessmen and members of the middle class, who have been particularly affected by the crisis and by nepotism, which has increased since Yanukovych was elected.\nA number of initiatives under Yanukovych’s presidency have irritated voters keen to defend the Ukrainian language and identity. They include a law on regional languages that came into effect in summer 2012 and allows regions that wish to do so to make Russian their second official language, or to reduce Ukrainian language-teaching in schools, as it is “unnecessary”, according to the education minister, Dmytro Tabachnyk.\nThough re-centred, Svoboda is still anchored in the far right. Its lead policy is the strengthening of Ukrainian national identity, which implies an end to Russian influence. On the foreign policy side, this translates into a wish to see Ukraine join NATO, rearm with nuclear weapons and leave all post-Soviet cooperative organisations.\nAmong Svoboda’s domestic priorities is “de-Sovietisation”: purging or sidelining former SNPU cadres and KGB agents, changing street and place names, removing monuments to heroes of the Soviet Union. Svoboda also proposes to abolish Crimea’s autonomous status and promote Ukrainian national identity through measures ranging from systematic glorification of the nationalist movement to reintroducing the mentions of religious affiliation and ethnicity on identity documents.\nSvoboda wants to see Ukraine join the EU. This pragmatic change of stance is inspired more by the tactical necessity for a “sacred union” with other opposition forces, and by electoral goals, than by a sincere desire to join, though Svoboda does also see the EU as a way of keeping Russia at a distance.\nThe party has also tried to disassociate itself from anti-Semitism, to the point where Joseph Zisels, chairman of the Association of Jewish Communities in the Ukraine, assured me that “Svoboda presents no threat to Jews. Their real enemy is the Russians. … It’s true that it’s the only major party to take Bandera andShukhevych (3) as its heroes, which I admit is awkward, but for all that it is not anti-Semitic.” This has not prevented a few slip-ups, for instance when Svoboda MP Igor Miroshnichenko in November 2012 denied that US actress Mila Kunis had Ukrainian roots, saying that she was in fact a jidovka, an ambiguous Ukrainian slang word meaning a person of Jewish faith or ancestry.\nSvoboda has been highly visible in Independence Square — it controlled Kiev city hall, occupied until 16 February — but ultimately has little influence over the demonstrators, as is the case for other opposition parties. This political void, coupled with the violence used by the authorities over the past few weeks, culminating in a pitched battle, has created conditions favourable to the emergence of new groups, whose style and ideological stance have raised many questions.\nThe biggest, Pravy Sektor (right sector), emerged after the Grushevsky Street clashes and, for the moment, enjoys real popular support. It has a few thousand members across the country, including people disappointed by Svoboda, members of ultra-nationalist groups, hooligans and dropouts. Their common denominator is a taste for radical action, and for the ideology that one of the movement’s leaders, Andrei Tarassenko, dispensed from its high-security headquarters on the fifth floor of Trade Union House, on Independence Square. Pravy Sektor defines itself as “neither xenophobic nor anti-Semitic, as Kremlin propaganda claims” and above all as “nationalist, defending the values of white, Christian Europe against the loss of the nation and deregionalisation”. Like Svoboda, it rejects multiculturalism, as “responsible for the disappearance of the crucifix and the arrival of girls in burqas in your schools”, but it does not advocate joining the EU, which it describes as “liberal totalitarianism in which God has vanished and values are turned upside down”.\nPravy Sektor supports none of the opposition parties, especially not Svoboda, disappointed by its “appeals for calm and negotiation with the authorities”. It could contemplate becoming a party itself, which would be awkward for Svoboda’s Tyahnybok: besides seeing his reputation as an anti-system champion seriously dented by his appeals for moderation during the clashes, he would have to come to terms with a party even further to the right, whose feats of arms and determination are known.\nSvoboda’s success over the past few years and the presence of neo-fascist groups such as Pravy Sektor in Independence Square are signs of a crisis in Ukrainian society. It is first and foremost a crisis of identity: in 22 years of independence, Ukraine has not managed to develop an unbiased historical narrative presenting a positive view of all its regions and citizens: even today, the Ukrainians are seen as liberators in Galicia but as fascists in Donbass. It is also a political crisis: some Ukrainians, exasperated and disappointed with the",

        "prompt": "A cartographer that created maps for senior policy makers at the National Counterterrorism Center wants to map out your next hunt or backpacking trip.\nBen Harshyne and his wife Kate Harshyne took a risk this year when Ben left his job as a contractor where he made maps for the National Counterterrorism Center and chose to work full time on a company he started called HUNTERRA Mapping.\nHUNTERRA creates maps by blending high-resolution aerial photography with a 3D-like terrain model. The company can create waterproof, tear resistant field maps, poster maps and custom-sized mega maps.\nHarshyne got the idea for the company after he made a hunting map for his father for Father’s Day four years ago. He didn’t want to create a map with only an aerial photo because it only showed tree cover, and terrain was important to understand the best places to deer hunt. Harshyne upgraded it by blending in terrain by simulating shadows created from the sun. He also digitized the trails, and highlighted the family’s different tree stands.\nHis father was impressed by the product and the map proved useful in the following hunting season.\nOn a hunting trip to Illinois, Harshyne and his father showed the map to the owner of an outfitting company. He was similarly impressed since he typically printed his maps off on Google. The outfitter, Aaron Milliken, went on to work for a real estate company called Whitetail Properties that sells hunting properties.\nHarshyne first thought he had an opportunity to build the business that became HUNTERRA once Whitetail Properties asked him to build maps to show off the property listings. Harshyne stood up HUNTERRA in 2011, but he was still working on the maps part time while he maintained his full time post at NCTC.\nThe company continued to grow as Harshyne designed a website where hunters could visit and order maps specific to their upcoming hunts. The work load grew and eventually Kate Harshyne quit her job in the culinary industry to work on HUNTERRA full time.\nThe Harshynes went all in this summer when Ben quit his job and the couple sold their northern Virginia home to move to the Midwest and be closer to the hunting grounds that they most often map. In fact, the couple refurbished a 1979 Airstream Excella trailer and is driving across the U.S. to promote HUNTERRA.\nThe company currently offers three types of maps: the field map, the poster map and the mega map. The field map is a tear resistant, waterproof map that hunters or hikers can fold up and store in their pocket. The map is 10 x 15 inches and is meant to accompany you in the field, and can be marked up with dry erase Crayons or permanent Sharpies.\nThe poster map comes in three sizes -- 20 x 30 inches, 30 x 45 inches and 40 x 60 inches. A light adhesive on the back makes it easy to hang on the wall or stick to a table.\nThe mega map allows hunters and bikers to pick any size. Harshyne said he uses a mosaic of multiple sheets to build huge displays for large properties and ranches without losing the detail that his customers require.\nHUNTERRA has already received national exposure through its work with Whitetail Properties.

        "prompt": "Big news in the world of food policy, farming and antibiotic use: Perdue Farms, the third-largest chicken producer in the United States, announced today that during the past decade it has ceased using most of the antibiotics that formerly propped up its chicken production.\nThere are caveats to that \"most,\" and I'll explain them. But it's important to say up front that this is a nationally significant move and looks like an industry-leading step.\ninjecting meat chickens with antibiotics while still in the shell.\nThose restrictions mean the company has eliminated most of the uses of antibiotics that public health campaigners have been concerned about since the 1970s, and has gone beyond current federal requirements for what can be done to meat chickens before they hatch. And while the impact probably can't be measured with precision as long as other firms continue to use antibiotics routinely, it seems likely that Perdue has taken an important step in reducing the amount of antibiotic resistance that comes off farms and causes human illness.\nThe company said it began its antibiotic reduction program 12 years ago. The trigger for today's announcement was completing the removal of antibiotic use from its hatcheries, which was a five-year project that ended this summer.\n\"When we started hearing from consumers that they were becoming concerned about the amount of antibiotics used to raise chickens they were buying, we were listening,\" company chairman Jim Perdue said at the DC briefing. \"Coupled with information coming from the USDA and FDA and other sources, we began to look critically at our practices. It wasn't easy...but we found along the way that we could raise healthy chickens with fewer antibiotics.\"\nRoutine antibiotic use in meat production – that is, giving meat animals small doses of antibiotics every day in food or water, to make them put on weight faster and to prevent disease from the conditions they live in – has been under scrutiny for decades. The first federal action addressing it happened just last December, when the FDA asked veterinary pharmaceutical manufacturers to relabel the antibiotics they make, so that \"growth promotion\" – that weight-gain use – would become an unapproved, technically illegal use of the drug.\nThe concern that lies behind routine animal antibiotic use is that most of the drugs used on farms are the same ones used against infections that humans develop. Bacteria in animals' guts or on their skin develop resistance to protect themselves; when the animals are slaughtered, or their manure washes or wafts off the farm property, the resistant bacteria go along too. When humans pick up those bacteria from meat or the environment, they can't be treated – because the drug needed to cure them is the same one that was used on the farm in the first place.\nThe \"ionophore exception\" is why the Perdue announcement and release today included words like \"fewer\" from Perdue himself, and statements like this from Dr. Bruce Stewart-Brown, Senior Vice President of Food Safety, Quality and Live Operations: “By no longer using any antibiotics in our hatcheries or any human antibiotics in feed, we’ve reached the point where 95 percent of our chickens never receive any human antibiotics, and the remainder receive them only for a few days when prescribed by a veterinarian.\"\nStewart-Brown said during the briefing that the company's ionophore use is also trending down, but wasn't willing to give figures. The only birds to receive the ionophores, he said, are the company's regular brand of chicken; neither the organic nor the \"no antibiotics ever\" lines do. However, he said, animals that get sick will be treated with antibiotics if the company's veterinarians think it is needed, but then will be sold under the regular brand.\nTo compensate for the lost effect of the antibiotics the company relinquished, Stewart-Brown said they also improved chickens' diets by removing animal byproducts and going to an all-vegetable feed of soybean meal and corn oil; using prebiotics and probiotics including \"oregano and yucca\" and \"yogurt type things\"; increasing the number of vaccinations chickens receive; and doubling down on cleaning chicken \"houses,\" the long sheds that can hold tens of thousands of broilers at a time.\n\"This doesn't mean we are done,\" he said. \"We constantly learn new things and try to evolve our program.\"\nCampaigners for reduced antibiotic use mostly supported the comprehensive moves.\nGail Hansen, a public health veterinarian with the Pew Charitable Trusts, told me: \"This is a lot of what we have been asking for, for six years, so it is pretty positive,\" adding that she would like to see the company be more specific about the amounts of ionophores it uses and about better husbandry practices that could help boost broiler chickens' immune systems.\nCaroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said: \"The amount of antibiotics used on the farm is simply not sustainable if we want to preserve their uses in human medicine. I hope Perdue's actions foreshadow changes across the industry, and embolden regulators to prohibit the misuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture.\"\nJonathan Kaplan, Natural Resources Defense Council: \"Jim Perdue [says]: '… human-approved antibiotics should not be used to boost production or in place of responsible animal husbandry or hatchery management.' We agree!... We’d like to hear more about how Perdue is verifying these accomplishments and hope the company will also publish its actual antibiotic use data.\"\nSusan Vaughn Grooters of Keep Antibiotics Working praised the moves but raised a concern about birds that are outside Perdue's system but feed into it: the great-grandparent and grandparent birds that",

The use of VPNs (virtual private networks) was commonplace in territories that didn’t have an official Netflix service, such as the Middle East, or even in places like Australia where Netflix was available but with a limited library.

        "prompt": "It wasn't so long ago that Warren Buffet painted Google as a wonderfully lucky company that could make boatloads of money while spending practically none.\nAccording the Buffet—the Oracle of Omaha, the most successful investor in the history of Wall Street—Google could build enormously profitable web services, from search to Gmail, without investing in big stuff like land and buildings and hardware. \"It's far better to have an ever-increasing stream of earnings with virtually no major capital requirements,\" he wrote in a 2007 letter to those with shares in his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway. \"Ask Microsoft or Google.\"\nIt was a ridiculous statement then, and in hindsight, it was a howler for the ages—especially when you consider who wrote it. This became particularly clear last week, when Google released its latest financial statements. In 2014, Google said, it spent nearly $11 billion on big stuff like land and buildings and hardware. In other words, it spent more on the big stuff than Intel, the world's largest computer chip maker and a company whose capital spending was traditionally a high-water mark for tech businesses.\nWhile Intel spent about $10 billion on the property, massive manufacturing plants, and equipment needed to build all those chips, Google spent $11 billion expanding a very different kind of business. Yes, it may have spent money on equipment needed to manufacture things like phones and smart thermostats, but the main point here is that the company likely shells out far more on the data centers, computer servers, and networking equipment needed to operate its vast online empire.\nThe world, you see, has changed. Google's $11 billion is a wonderfully succinct symbol for an enormous shift in modern technology, a shift that will only get bigger in the years to come. What the Oracle of Omaha failed to realize is that in the future, the Googles and Microsofts will be among the biggest spenders, not the smallest. And together with Apple and Amazon, they will use such enormous spending to replace the very foundations of modern technology, pushing aside not only Intel, but also old-school computer makers such as Dell, HP, EMC, and others.\n\"What has happened in the last 10 years is that the players thought to have no capital expense are actually spending more than those, like Intel, that were held up as the most capital intense,\" says Horace Dediu, a tech financial analyst with a think tank called the Clayton Christensen Institute. \"As things move to the cloud, the effect is on Intel and HP and Dell and on the IT departments of the world—an entire power-base for how IT decisions are made.\"\nIn expanding their already vast internet empires, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple are spending unprecedented amounts on the data centers and hardware devices that underpin their online services. And as these internet giants push into cloud computing—offering services that let outside companies, developers, and individuals run software and store data without setting up their own machines—they're eating away at the market for PCs, computer servers, storage hardware, and other stuff sold by the likes of Dell and HP. In the long run, they may undermine even Intel's chip business.\nThe world isn't just moving its software onto cloud computing services. Increasingly, we're tapping into this online software from smartphones and other mobile devices—many built by Apple and Google—and typically, these mobile devices eschew chips from Intel in favor of designs from rival ARM. Intel still supplies many of chips that help drive online services inside data centers operated by the likes of Google and Microsoft, but this may change—with at least",

Catholic Charities is there.\nThe mission of Catholic Charities is to provide services to anyone in need, regardless of race or religion; to advocate justice, human dignity and quality of life; and to call all people to join in these efforts; thereby reflecting the compassion of God in Christ.\n\"That means that we are ready to serve the neediest among us — of all ages, all backgrounds and all challenges,\" said Lauren Weedon Hopkins, executive director for Catholic Charities Jacksonville. \"I don't think most people realize that 85 percent of those we help are not Catholic. It doesn't matter to us — we do what we do to be a good neighbor.\"\nThe programs offered by Catholic Charities are many and varied. The organization feeds the hungry, helps out with bills, settles refugees into this country, facilitates adoptions and helps out with school supplies, among other services.\nThe Jacksonville Regional Office is the largest in the state, serving Duval, Baker, Clay, Nassau and northern St. Johns counties.\nThe programs offered by Catholic Charities Jacksonville are many and varied. The organization feeds the hungry, helps out with bills, settles refugees into this country, facilitates adoptions and helps out with school supplies, among other services.\nIn September 2017, Catholic charities launched a two-year global campaign to welcome refugees and migrants under the leadership of Pope Francis, but the organization's Refugee Resettlement Program in Northeast Florida has been going on for many decades to help resettle individuals and reunite families who legally enter the United States.\nThe program, one of the largest in the state, assists refugees when they first arrive and for up to five years afterward. Clients receive extensive medical background and relationship checks before travel to the U.S. is approved. Many have fled their home countries because of persecution due to their race, religion, nationality or membership in a social or political group and have nowhere else to turn.\n\"From July 2016 to June 2017, we helped 152 refugees get settled into this country,\" Hopkins said. \"We assist in finding housing and provide classes in English as a Second Language, and we've set up a grant-matching program through which 260 refugees have already found jobs. We've found that refugees really want to work, so with training and an understanding of the workplace, they will be excellent employees.\"\nCamp I Am Special serves children and adults with disabilities in seven week-long overnight-camp sessions where each camper is paired one-on-one with a high-school buddy who helps with everything the camper does.The program is as popular with volunteers as it is with participants and has a waiting list of 150 volunteers.\nMany of those helped by Catholic Charities' Refugee Resettlement Program have limited English skills and employment histories, so ESL classes and help finding jobs is essential. Others have experienced emotional trauma, torture, the loss of family members or long years in refugee camps, making it necessary to \"tread lightly\" with an understanding heart.\n\"We have a very diverse staff of 62 employees in Jacksonville, with some members coming here as refugees themselves,\" Hopkins said. \"They have an immediate rapport with new arrivals, especially those from their home countries.\"\nRefugees aren't the only people having a difficult time finding employment, which is why Catholic Charities also offers a Workforce Development program.\n\"Five years ago, we were seeing many who had lost jobs and wanted desperately to get back to work,\" Hopkins said. \"With a three-year start-up grant from the Jessie Ball DuPont Fund, we have helped 937 people in the last five years, with 411 gaining employment.\"\nThe weeklong program offers job readiness classes, help with resume-writing and interviewing, as well as a closet filled with clothes appropriate for job interviews. Then, for up to four months afterward, participants can come back to the center to use the computers, get help with cover letters and apply for jobs.\n\"We also help with some of the barriers to employment — arrange child care, provide bus passes and appropriate clothing,\" Hopkins said. \"And we work with the Family Foundation to provide mental health counseling for those who are not yet ready to work.\n\"The main point with all our programs is that we treat each participant as an individual, showing compassion and love, and listening to what they have to say. These are individuals and a one-size-fits-all approach simply won't work.\"\nCatholic Charities' Immigration and Legalization program works with immigrants of all types, not just refugees. The program has been accredited for more than 10 years by the Council on Accreditation — only nine organizations in Jacksonville have that accreditation — and by the Department of Justice, so its staff can do the work that an immigration attorney would do. In the past year, the program has helped 512 documented immigrants with their paperwork.\nHigh on the list of programs that everyone — participants and staff alike — loves is Camp I Am Special, also ACA accredited for children and adults with disabilities. The camp serves those ages five through 65 in seven weeklong overnight-camp sessions, during which each participant is paired one-on-one with a high-school buddy who helps with absolutely everything.\n\"This has been going on for 34 years with an incredible amount of success,\" Hopkins said. \"I was actually a volunteer for four summers while I was in high school and so was my brother. It was there that he learned to have a love for these special children. He went on to medical school to become a pediatrician with a specialty in autism, and it's all because of volunteering at Camp I Am Special. It's such a wonderful experience that earlier volunteers are now doctors, nurses and lead nonprofits. Right now, there is a volunteer waiting list with 150 names on it.\"\nResponse from the community has been generous as well. When the camp's 50-year-old swimming pool was finally declared unusable, $900,000 was raised and a new pool, designed by Auld & White, is scheduled to open in December.\nBecause Catholic Charities is",

        "prompt": "Kevin Hunter has been fired as an executive producer on his estranged wife Wendy Williams' show, as the $215K Ferrari he bought for his baby mama is towed away, DailyMail.com can reveal.\nWilliams decided she finally had enough of her philandering husband of nearly 22 years and served him divorce papers at her TV studio in Manhattan last Thursday.\nThe 47-year-old was fired from the show and as Wendy's manager, a source on the show confirmed to DailyMail.com.\nThe source also said Hunter had been given 48 hours to remove his belongings from their marital home in Livingston, New Jersey as she was seen apartment hunting in New York City on Tuesday.\nWendy reached her tipping point after learning Hunter had been living the high life with his decade-long mistress Sharina Hudson, who gave birth last month, splurging on Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and gifting her with diamonds.\nHunter released an apology on Tuesday admitting he was not 'proud of his recent actions' and was 'trying to right some wrongs' while taking 'full accountability' for what he had done.\nHis groveling statement came after the flashy $215,000-plus gold Ferrari Portofino he gifted Hudson was seen being towed away - a day after Wendy hit him with the divorce papers.\nThe source said: 'Kevin had expected to stay on at the show and as Wendy's manager. He ran the show with an iron fist, he was the guy who kept the vultures away.\n'But when Wendy saw the photos of him and Sharina last week on the Daily Mail going out for dinner and her driving around in a Ferrari she was furious.\n'That's what tipped her over the edge, she was like, \"he's gotta go\". She now wants him out of her life completely, she's given him 48 hours to clear his office and clear his belongings out of the house.\nA day after DailyMail.com published photos of the new Ferrari that Hunter gifted Hudson, it was loaded onto a truck and taken away.\nA Ferrari dealership from Greenwich, Connecticut, picked the golden car up, as two men who appear to be helpers for Hunter looked on.\nHunter's statement on Tuesday read: '28 years ago I met an amazing woman: Wendy Williams. At the time, I didn't realize that she would not only become my wife, but would also change the face of entertainment and the world.\n'I have dedicated most of our lives to the business empire that is Wendy Williams Hunter, a person that I truly love and respect unconditionally.\nI am not proud of my recent actions and take full accountability and apologize to my wife, my family and her amazing fans. I am going through a time of self-reflection and am trying to right some wrongs.\n'No matter what the outcome is or what the future holds, we are still The Hunter Family and I will continue to work with and fully support my wife in this business and through any and all obstacles she may face living her new life of sobriety, while I also work on mine.\nOn Monday, Wendy kicked off her Hot Topics segment by revealing she was just a few days away from moving out the sober living facility she has called home for the past few weeks, and is ready to start a new life for herself and her son Kevin Jr. - the son she shares with Hunter.\nDailyMail.com exclusively revealed in early March the TV host had been living in the sober home in Queens, New York, to battle an addiction to alcohol and prescription pills, her downward spiral sparked by learning Hunter was still seeing Hudson.\nMeanwhile, Hunter has been spending time with Hudson, who recently gave birth, at a hideaway in Edgewater, New Jersey.\nThe two seem to be living the high life, going out for dinner dates and driving new luxury vehicles.\nHunter was seen driving a new maroon convertible Rolls-Royce last Saturday to pick up Hudson and take her out to dinner, with the massage therapist proudly showing off her post baby pooch.\nThe 33-year-old, whose hair was freshly curled, carried a $5,200 quilted Chanel purse while wearing a chunky diamond chain necklace and diamond studs.\nWhile Hunter treated his baby mama to a Ferrari, he seems to have also treated himself to new cars, including the luxury Rolls-Royce.\nHudson was seen driving her new sports car last Monday, exiting the flashy vehicle in a $1,260 Thom Browne tracksuit that showed off her post-baby body.\nAnd Kevin has spared no expense on his own duds as well, seen one day in a $1,500 Fendi vest, $490 Fendi hat, $770 Fendi pants and $515 Fendi sunglasses.\nThe couple have been hiding out in New Jersey weeks after Hudson was secreted away to Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia to give birth in order to avoid media attention.\nHunter has been seen at the secret hideaway chauffeuring Sharina around.\nKevin was served with divorce papers from Wendy last Thursday morning at the TV studio, according to TMZ.\nExtra security was hired in case Kevin, known to have a temper, got enraged on set. But there were apparently no outbursts.\nThe split will most likely be contested as Hunter is an executive producer on Williams' TV show and told Hudson that he couldn't afford to split from Wendy because she paid all the bills, a source previously told DailyMailTV.\nIn New Jersey, parties can file fault or no-fault. Fault allows a judge to dock alimony based on the seriousness of the offense. Proving will not be hard for either side in this case.\nReasons for fault include adultery, abandonment, physical or emotional abuse, and alcohol or drug abuse.\nWilliams filing for divorce comes after DailyMailTV revealed she had been living in a sober living home in Queens, New York, being treated for addiction to booze and prescription drugs.\nHer downward spiral was sparked in December after she learned Hunter was still seeing Hudson, his mistress of more than a decade.\nMeanwhile, Williams seemed to be in good spirits on her morning show on Thursday.\nA source previously told DailyMailTV that Wendy was keeping her ring on during filming until she worked out what to do with Hunter, but was taking it off once outside of the studio.\nA recently resurfaced excerpt from Williams' memoir reveals that she vowed to leave her husband if another woman had his child.\nWendy wrote in her 2001 memoir it would be one of the only things that would make her part ways from Hunter once and for all after revealing he'd already cheated on her earlier on in their relationship.\nWilliams' marital problems are the root of cause of her addiction to booze and pills, kicking off last December when the star hired a private investigator to spy on Hunter who she suspected was still carrying on with Hudson, DailyMailTV revealed last month.\nIn 2017, Hudson had been at the center of a DailyMail.com investigation that exposed her ten-year affair with Williams' husband.\nAfter being told the secret affair was still very much alive, the TV host confronted Hunter demanding to know why he was still seeing the 33-year-old qualified massage therapist.\nDuring the heated clash, it's believed Williams fell and hit her shoulder on the ground, suffering a hairline fracture.\nDevastated, Williams quickly plunged into a depression while recovering from the injury and began drinking heavily. During the time away from hosting her show, Williams' drinking - coupled with powerful pain medication - proved a potent cocktail. Williams, who has a history of drug addiction, became hooked.\nAfter returning from rehab in Florida, Williams began living in a sober home in Queens, which is situated above a barbershop in an unassuming red brick building in Long Island City.\nBut when news broke that Hudson had given birth to a little girl in late March, she checked herself out of her sober living home and started drinking - eventually being found by her team who took her to the hospital to sober up.\nIt's",

But after the visitor, dubbed the “Poe Toaster,” failed to appear two years in a row, Poe fans are planning one last vigil this week before calling an end to the annual Jan. 19 tradition.\nThe gothic master’s tales of the macabre still connect with readers more than 200 years after his birth, including his most famous poem, “The Raven,” and short stories including “The Tell-Tale Heart” and “The Pit and the Pendulum.” Poe’s “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” is considered the first modern detective story.\nPoe House and Museum Curator Jeff Jerome, who has kept watch for the “Poe Toaster” since 1978, believes that it’s Poe’s suffering and his lifelong dream to be a poet that people still relate to. While the midnight tribute has a touch of the theatrical, it’s also an honest expression, Jerome said. Wherever Jerome travels in the world, he said when people find out what he does, they want to know whether the “Poe Toaster” is real.\nPoe lived for a time in Baltimore, but died in 1849 at age 40 after collapsing in a tavern during a visit to the city years later.

        "prompt": "Delicacy of Japanese techniques matches with the exotic flavors of Peru to wow discerning diners this season at MGM Cotai’s Aji.\nIn the world of Nikkei cuisine, where Japanese concepts of gastronomy influence Peruvian cuisine, Mitsuharu Tsumura is one of the most well-known chefs who has brought his own ideas and passions from his country and introduced them to the world.\n“To me, Peruvian cuisine is heavy metal music and Japanese cuisine is classical music. The two need to harmonize well together in a perfect combination. It is important that we understand the DNA of both cuisines,” explains Peru’s star chef of the restaurant “Maido” in Lima, a Nikkei concept which ranked seventh in the San Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurants 2018.\nFor the new menu at MGM Cotai’s signature Nikkei restaurant, Aji, Tsumura, widely known as Chef Micha, works with his team, led by Chef Edwin Guzman Navarro and Manager Alexandre Santos.\nTheir goal is to elevate the original menu to another level and feature their best efforts and creativity. Additional ingredients from Peru are imported to make the taste profile more complex. The result is an explosion of well-balanced flavors and aesthetics that surprises the senses.\nUmami takes center stage for creations like Causa: mashed potato filled with yellow chilli, king crab, and salmon roe layered on a bed of black rice cracker.\nFor lovers of beef tartar, Aji’s version of the raw beef delight is enhanced with sea urchin, quail egg, and truffle chapla.\nMushroom fanatics will be thrilled by mushroom, shiitake, enoki and king oyster mushroom in broth.\nLastly, the Rocoto, a dessert filled with coconut, cinnamon foam, chocolate praline and peanut ice cream, sweetens the palate with its diverse textures, making it the perfect conclusion to a rich meal characterized by sophisticated combinations and innovative artistry.\nAfter the tasting, the Times sat down with the Nikkei chefs for a conversation.\nMacau Daily Times (MDT) – How do you work with Chef Edwin?\nChef Mitsuharu Tsumura (MT) – I communicate constantly with Edwin. For the first few months of the first year, I was more involved creatively. Now I give ideas, but I would say that 80 or 90 percent of the job is done by [Chefs] Edwin and Aldo. Actually, they come up with ideas and they ask me, “what do you think about this?” And we take the ideas from there. Edwin and Aldo know what kind of flavors I like. I also give him ideas. So it’s team work, but it’s mostly executed by Aldo and Edwin.\nMDT – You talk through Facetime?\nEdwin has always been a very talented and creative chef. He worked with me in Maido. He won the best young chef [award] in Peru, the contest. Edwin has really developed a good relationship with everybody in the hotel, with the team, and outside the hotel. Also in Hong Kong. He is very easy going. When I came this time, I was surprised because everybody knows him and he knows everybody. I feel proud and very happy because before coming here, it was a challenge, but I think he has done very well and engaged with the people.\nMDT – Can you talk about your experience in Macau?\nChef Edwin Guzman Navarro (EGN) – It was a challenge when Mitsuharu made the decision to choose myself and Aldo to come to Macau and develop the concept here in China. It was a challenge looking for products similar to the Peruvian ones and starting to cook with people who don’t know anything about your cuisine and your flavors. But I can say the first year was very good also. We were tired but enjoyed the work.\nMDT – How do you overcome the problem of importing products?\nEGN – When the Hong Kong- Macau-Zhuhai Bridge was finished, we were thinking maybe the problem can be fixed because half of the products [can be found] in Hong Kong, but delivery is not easy. We have some ingredients flown directly from Peru, but it’s very expensive.\nPeruvian cuisine is developing in Asia, more in Hong Kong than in Macau, and the products are going to Hong Kong first and then sent to other places. We are still trying to find new suppliers.\nMDT – And ingredients from Japan?\nEGN – I went with Mitsuharu to Japan and tried the food there. I saw the ingredients, but was not very familiar with all of them. Actually, we always ask Mitsuharu how we should cook with those products that we never saw in our life.\nMDT – What about the kitchen, is it to your liking?\nMT – It’s a dream kitchen. I said when I open this restaurant in Macau, it has to be the kitchen of my dreams. [MGM] hired a designer and everything, but I want to design it myself. So, I went back to Peru and I drew it there. I want this station here, pastry there, etc. Plunger here, walks here. So, it’s not a typical kitchen, it has many stations. It’s like a fish bowl.\nMDT – Is the new menu an elevation of the previous menu?\nMT – We try to make something special for our guests. Engawa, for example, is top quality and a precious part of the fish, but most people don’t know what it is.\nWhen I first went to Japan I didn’t know about it because in Peru, we don’t use it; we throw it away because it’s hard [to cook with]. But now they’re using it. Some 17 years ago or so, my boss in Japan said, “Okay cut the fish.” I cut the fish and left the Engawa and he got mad because I threw it away. “Where’s the Engawa? Why not use that? That is the most expensive part of the fish. That’s worth the same amount as the whole fish,” he added. I’m never going to forget that. If you don’t go very well into the bone of the fish, you can lose half of the Engawa. These tough parts of the fish are the best parts for cooking… because they’re very hard when they are raw, but they are very tender when they are cooked.\nMDT – Who are the clients?\nAlexandre Santos (AS) – Expat and local Chinese community. They accept the food but it is very new for them. You need to really take an effort to explain what the dish is. After opening up the menu, we try our best to go to the table and start to explain.\nMT – I was happy to hear that 80 percent or more of the customers of Aji are locals.\nAS – In the beginning it was like the ‘curiosity stage’ of the whole hotel. It was the first Peruvian and then Nikkei Restaurant in Macau and it was challenging then. […] I got a chance to go to Peru almost a year and a half ago. Chef Micha took me out to many different places, like even fish markets, a French market and different restaurants with different types of cuisine and this overcame a lot of basic challenges, for example, how we can explain the dishes to the guests.\nMDT – Chef Micha, what is your goal for the future?\nMT – I take life day-by-day. I don’t like to plan, but I have to plan sometimes because that’s the way my work is. Many people think I’m very organized, but I am not. When I wake up every day, I try to make my day perfect. But when I plan something too much, it doesn’t work. That has happened to me. So the best things in my life have happened without planning. So, I really don’t know what I’m going to do. One of the things I know I’m going to do is that I’m going to close my restaurant in Lima. Maido is going to close in approximately three or four more years.\nMy concept in Chile and China are basically the only two concepts that are this elaborate. What I open in the future will be very casual. I am not looking to be in a ranking, just [to make] good food at a good price. I want to make my food more democratic. I want to open more concepts where everybody can go. That is happiness. We can make tasty food without it being so expensive. The future of food is informality. Do whatever you want. If you want to eat with your hands, eat with your hands. No dress code. There’s no better way to eat than the way",

His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol.\nAn initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact. After interviewing and examining him, I recapped why he had been hospitalized and explained that hospitalized for a few more days while we monitored his liver function.\nHere was a patient with a damaged liver and little mystery about what had caused it, and yet here he was, with questions about… mold?\nThis was not the first—and certainly won’t be the last—patient to ask about mold. My patients have often wondered aloud whether mold is causing their breathing troubles, sinus congestion, overwhelming fatigue, and so on. Ultimately, I told this patient the same thing I told all the others: Mold exposure was not responsible for your health problems.\nMold worries are generally unfounded. There is no evidence that otherwise healthy individuals have any reason to fear falling ill from building mold, mold inhalation, or any other type of exposure to so-called toxic mold (PDF). Even when it comes to water-damaged buildings, any medically proven associations with health issues have come with long-term occupational exposures—not household exposures.\nIf you need more assurance, look no further than a study that examined residents of post-Katrina New Orleans: It didn’t find any increased risk of adverse respiratory effects from water-damaged buildings. This helps explain why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) doesn’t recommend routine mold testing in households, instead suggesting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) guide to mold control to ensure indoor air quality in high moisture environments.\nThat said, mold can cause health problems in certain populations—but typically, it only seriously affects patients who have underlying health conditions. Specifically, immunocompromised patients could be at risk of systemic fungal infections, and patients prone to allergic rhinitis or allergic asthma could have responses to inhaled mold.\nThere are skin and blood-testing methods available to determine whether patients truly have mold allergies or not. Additionally, anybody who has had long-term occupational exposure to mold could develop a rare disease known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which affects lung function. But beyond these medically established connections to mold exposure and medical illnesses, much of the rest is internet lore.\nSo, unless you’re in one of those rare categories, you don’t have anything to fear about exposure—and yet mold hysteria is fairly widespread. Why?\nThe answer is a depressing case study in internet-era medical misinformation, rumor-mongering, and irresponsible online doctoring. In short, some irresponsible people are drumming up fears about mold and then profiting off of those fears. These profits come at the expense of patients like mine who use these theories as scapegoats, failing to understand and tackle the real medical issues at hand.\nOn the surface, there certainly appears to be a wealth of online information about the supposedly harmful effects of mold exposure. A quick Google search of “mold” and “fatigue” will draw your attention to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).\nProponents of CFS justify the condition on the basis of one very flawed study that drew an association between mold and the syndrome, relying entirely on “urine mycotoxin” data—or the levels of fungal metabolites in urine. Not long the paper was published, the CDC issued a statement on the lack of clinical validity of urine mycotoxin tests, effectively invalidating its results.\nWhen contacted for comment, Brewer said that he relies on the clinical picture and symptoms to diagnose CFS, based on the CDC’s 1994 case definition. He still offers urine mycotoxin testing to his patients, despite the CDC’s own website clearly stating that there is no “lab test or biomarker” for CFS and no single identifiable cause.\nThe mold-CFS internet monster is nothing compared to the “Surviving Mold” empire created by Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker. Shoemaker’s website discusses mold-induced chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS) ad nauseum. This disease encompasses a gamut of vague symptomatology, defined as “an acute and chronic, systemic inflammatory response syndrome” in response to mold, bacteria, and other “pro-inflammatory” exposures. The scientific evidence to back up CIRS is severely lacking, and if you search for more details on specific clinical descriptors, you will end up empty-handed.\nPerhaps inevitably, Shoemaker offers to train (for a fee) other physicians with his “Shoemaker Protocol,” a program to help them detect and treat CIRS. Online memberships are offered for all website visitors, ranging in price from $19.50 per month to $175 for a 12-month subscription. The memberships offer screening tools, email consultations with Shoemaker, and other “Surviving Mold” materials.\nDespite the fact that Shoemaker has been out of clinical practice since 2013 and has come under fire by both his state medical board and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for unregulated online portal and practice methods, the website is still thriving and propagating myths that spread to other “alternative health” websites.\nWhen asked for comment, Shoemaker told The Daily Beast “you have your facts wrong,” and declined to reply to further emails.\nIf any myth is more pervasive than that of toxic mold and systemic illness, it is the earlier mentioned water-damaged buildings and “mycotoxicosis” legend. Proponents of mycotoxicosis suggest that mold in such buildings can trigger inflammatory processes that lead to immunologic changes and a gamut of symptoms—ranging from neurological complaints to pulmonary issues. The study of post-Katrina New Orleans residents should have debunked all of this, but there still is a wealth of false information online about water-damaged buildings and the illnesses they allegedly cause.\nHere, one of the biggest figures is a Dr. William Rea, who came under fire from the Texas medical board for multiple complaints, including using “pseudoscientific test methods,” offering inaccurate diagnoses, providing inappropriate treatments, practicing",

        "prompt": "Paleo diets avoid foods that came with modern agriculture.\n1 What is the Paleo Diet?\n4 Does the Paleo Diet Eliminate Healthy Foods Like Brown Rice?\nYou might not be a caveman, but proponents claim it's advantageous to eat like one. This means sticking to foods that were available to your Paleolithic ancestors during a prehistoric era that ended about 15,000 years ago. While Loren Cordain, author of \"The Paleo Diet,\" is perhaps one of the most well-known proponents of this way of eating, you can find slightly different types of paleo diets.\nLoren Cordain recommends avoiding dairy, eggs, grains and legumes and focusing on lean meat, fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts and seeds. Cordain claims the paleo people ate a relatively low-carbohydrate diet, so his approach places emphasis on lean meats above all. On the other hand, Arthur De Vany, author of \"The New Evolution Diet,\" claims that your paleo ancestors mainly foraged for plants and hunted meat when they could. His paleo-style diet places emphasis on vegetables and fruit, not meat. He does not exclude starchy vegetables, and he recommends eating at least 25 percent of your vegetables raw.\nIf you cringe at the thought of avoiding dairy and eggs, perhaps Mark Sisson, author of \"The Primal Blueprint,\" has the diet for you. Although he claims your paleo ancestors thrived on a plant-based diet, he doesn't exclude dairy and eggs. Sisson recommends choosing raw, grass-fed or fermented dairy products, but he recommends having fruits and vegetables make up the bulk of your diet. In addition, Sisson recommends wild-caught fish and grass-fed meat. He, too, recommends avoiding grains, legumes, processed oils and table sugar.\nRobb Wolf, author of \"The Paleo Solution,\" has similar recommendations to Loren Cordain. However, he takes a slightly different approach when it comes to meat. Wolf doesn't seem to think animal fat is a major problem and recommends meat such as pork chops, bacon and fatty cuts of steak that you'd normally avoid on other paleo-style diets. Wolf emphasizes grass-",

        "prompt": "New York's remaining opponents have a combined 22-28 record.\nHere's a stunner: the Jets would be in the playoffs if the regular season ended today.\nYes, those Jets. The group many thought would struggle to come close to last year's total of six wins. The team that some ranked at the bottom of the NFL entering the season.\nAs unlikely as it seemed a few months ago, or even just a few days ago, Rex Ryan's bunch has made a firm statement as it heads into the bye-week break. These Jets don't plan on going away anytime soon.\n\"At the end of the day, we're not worried about what people expected of us,\" defensive lineman Muhammad Wilkerson said. \"We know what we're capable of doing as a team and as an organization.\"\nIn the up-and-down world that is the Jets' season, opinions continue to fluctuate on whether this team could be a serious playoff contender. But after a surprising 26-20 win over New Orleans on Sunday, the question might be: Why not?\nAfter all, they're 5-4 and currently hold the No. 6 spot in the AFC playoff picture.\n\"People didn't really expect a whole lot out of us this year,\" tight end Konrad Reuland said. \"I think the only people who did expect a lot out of us was ourselves.\"\nBehind closed doors and away from the cameras, Ryan's confidence — in himself and his players — has never wavered.\n\"He's the fire,\" right guard Willie Colon said. \"The fire behind all this.\"\nIn the past, Ryan might have swung at the softball of a question when asked if he feels validated that the Jets have been proving their critics wrong. The \"new Rex\" isn't taking the bait these days.\n\"I don't think that way,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's a normal way of thinking or not. To me, it's like what is the challenge in front of you, and that's it. When I told you guys this year when I came back that I'm just treating it like it's a new beginning, that's how I've treated this from Day 1. Like it's just full speed ahead.\n\"I'm not looking down the road. I'm looking at what's right in front of me, like this is what we have to get done,\" he said.\nAt their worst, they're a mistake-prone group — led by an up-and-down Smith — that hardly resembles a playoff-caliber team, as shown in the 49-9 loss at Cincinnati last week.\nWin one, lose one. That's the trend so far, without fail.\nThe Jekyll-and-Hyde Jets are tough to figure out from one week to the next, but the fact they're nine games into the season with very real postseason aspirations is one of the league's most stunning developments.\n\"I wouldn't say it's a surprise to any of us in the building,\" a defiant general manager John Idzik said.\nThe Jets and owner Woody Johnson defied all logic in the offseason when they opted to fire GM Mike Tannenbaum, but retained Ryan. It's not the way most NFL teams operate, but it certainly set up this so-far unpredictable start by the Jets.\nThey're still defying logic. And now, they seek consistency.\nNew York's last seven opponents have a combined 22-28 record, including Miami (4-4), whom the Jets play twice in December. Only one of those teams has a winning record: Carolina, at 5-3.\n\"Right now, we're 5-4, we have seven games ahead of us",

        "prompt": "Trump on Charlottesville - stated the ‘obvious’ or is he ‘emotionally with KKK’?\nUS President Donald Trump has denounced the violence that erupted on Saturday in the city of Charlottesville, Virginia, saying both the far right and the left are to blame for the bloody clashes.\nHe was initially criticized for not explicitly condemning white supremacists rallying in Charlottesville.\nTrump also questioned the mounting campaign against Confederate monuments, saying that it could lead the US down a slippery slope and warned statues of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington could be the next to fall if the trend continues.\nUS mainstream media have been quick to paint Trump as a sympathizer of neo-Nazis and white supremacists.\n“I think they were just looking for any opportunity to fault him for saying what was obvious to anybody who watched that footage – which was there was violence coming from both sides,” Jim Jatras told RT.\n“Let’s be honest, for months in this country we’ve had this so-called Antifa, the so-called anti-fascist who frankly are fascists themselves, who use these Stormtrooper tactics to attack violently people they disagree with. They call them ‘racists’ even if they are not racists. You have people who can’t speak on college campuses – they’ll attack you if you wear a “Make America great again” hat and they’ve been doing it with impunity,” he added.\nAccording to the former diplomat, Trump was the right to call them out. “Of course he’s going to denounce, and rightly so, people who are in fact Nazis or Klansmen or things of their sort. But let’s not pretend that these people in black with the masks and the clubs are innocent,” he said.\nTrump has faced mounting pressure from lawmakers and the media to condemn the far right in stronger terms. However, the President said both sides of the conflict are to blame because “it has the virtue of being true,” Jatras said.\n“Where is the Justice Department Task Force, the civil rights Task Force looking into Antifa, and where their funding is coming from, and who is directing their violent activities. That side of the ledger is not shown. Frankly, I think the Republicans are just as complicit in this as the Democrats,” he added.\nFollowing the Charlottesville clashes, some American cities rushed to remove Confederate-era monuments. According to Brian Becker, these statues commemorate people who took up arms against the US government in defense on slavery.\n“These have been longstanding symbols of white supremacy and the defense of Jim Crow and Apartheid in America,” he told RT.\n“This would be like having a monument in Russia to Nazi Germany – that is what this means. These are the people who took up arms against the US government in defense of the system of slavery. Black people should not be forced to bow and walk in front of these monuments that are testimonials and celebration of their enslavement,” Becker continued.\n“The Washington Monument, the [Thomas] Jefferson Memorial, which are also monuments of slaveholders – that is not the point – these monuments have been built not as a national historical thing – it is about the white supremacy movement erecting them at the times in American history in the 1890’s and in the early 1920’s and right before that, when there was an effort to push back against black freedom,” he said.\nJohn Griffing, investigative reporter: Clearly both sides [of the clash in Charlottesville] were spurring for a fight. These were two very highly charged energized groups of people, but one had a permit to be there, and the other group did not have a permit to be there. And the police stood by, stood down, if you will, and allowed this violence to take place, and did not intervene. That is their dereliction of duty.\n“Look",
