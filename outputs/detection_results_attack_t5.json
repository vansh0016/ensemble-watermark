        "prompt": "Boston University men’s basketball led nearly wire-to-wire to win 68-54 in a Turnpike Trophy matchup against the College of the Holy Cross Wednesday night.\nBU (10-12, 3-6 Patriot League) snapped a four-game losing streak in front of a deafening crowd at Case Gym on Club Sports Night. The students never let up in cheering on their fellow Terriers in a big win for the team.\nRight away, BU looked primed to put on a show for their loud and proud supporters. Junior forward Tyler Scanlon scored six of the team’s first eight points on two threes, and in the first seven minutes the Terriers did not miss a shot.\nScanlon would lead all scorers in the first half with 12 points on 5-6 shooting from the floor.\nOn the defensive end, BU settled in to a 2-3 zone that they would use for the entire game. Although the Terriers gave up the ball a good amount themselves, their zone never allowed Holy Cross to get comfortable when the Crusaders (12-10, 3-6 Patriot League) were on offense.\nHoly Cross turned the ball over seven times in the first half, leading to several easy baskets for BU in transition. All night, BU defenders got into passing lanes and pestered Holy Cross ball handlers.\nAt the break, the Terriers led 30-26, but the score was not that close for long. BU went on a 21-9 run to start the half after big plays from junior forwards Max Mahoney and Tyler Scanlon.\nFirst, Mahoney raced down the floor for a putback dunk, forcing the Crusaders to call a timeout 2:16 into the half. Then, Scanlon came up with the steal and a dunk that sent the crowd into overdrive.\nA few minutes later, Mahoney made the crowd erupt again, scoring on a basket with a foul after a loose ball bounced off multiple players and sent a few to the floor. When the dust cleared, BU had a 51-35 lead and had effectively ended the game.\nThe duo of Scanlon and Mahoney was unstoppable against Holy Cross. Scanlon",

Her company, founded in 1997, currently performs various characters in history and develops literacy programs at schools, colleges, military bases, churches or where ever needed.\nBefore the audience at the Wagon Wheel Theater, Waddy-Thibodeaux transformed herself from a 20th century CEO into the legendary Harriet Tubman and relayed the story of the Underground Railroad, while delivering a message on the importance of literacy. She told the audience the Underground Railroad was \"Just people, people helping other people. And don't let nobody tell you no never mind that the Underground Railroad was all colored folks. No, there were Dutch, Portuguese, French, Chinese, Indian, white folks, colored, all of them working together,\" Waddy-Thibodeaux told the audience through her Harriet Tubman character.\nA powerful recital of Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech was also presented by 2nd Lt. Zayana Dennis and there was a musical performance by Pfc. Tamika Torain.\nThe Baumholder American Middle and High School allowed several students to attend the performance, which was held during school hours. After the performance, Lt. Col. Paul Pfahler, U.S. Army Garrison Baumholder commander, told the students, \"This is a better observance today because you're here, and I'd love to see the whole place next",

About an hour later, the SEC announced that it was seeking an emergency freeze on $27 million of proceeds from illegal stock sales. The SEC accused three defendants of conducting sales that violated Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, claiming that LongFin and CEO Venkata Meenavalli participated in and are liable for these violations. Shares of LongFin were up 47% at 10:01 a.m. EDT, the time of the halt, and were still halted as of 1:30 p.m. EDT.\nJune 16, 2017 to December 11, 2017: LongFin sold 1.14 million shares under SEC Regulation A, which allows companies to publicly sell shares with less burdensome procedures compared to Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.\nSeptember 15, 2017: LongFin and Meenavalli issued Altahawi about 2 million shares \"in consideration of purported legal and business consulting services performed by Altahawi.\" These shares were restricted securities that could not be resold, with limited exceptions.\nDecember 13, 2017: LongFin shares began trading on the Nasdaq exchange.\nAround December 15, 2017: LongFin announced the acquisition of Ziddu.com, which the SEC refers to as \"a purported cryptocurrency business\" owned by an entity at least 92%-owned by Meenavalli. Ziddu.com has no ascertainable value, according to the SEC. This acquisition drove a 2,662% gain within three days of the stock's first day of trading.\nJanuary 9, 2018: LongFin was out of compliance with its Exchange Act periodic reporting obligations, failing to file any quarterly and annual reports until April 2.\nBetween February 9, 2018 and March 23, 2018: Alt",
